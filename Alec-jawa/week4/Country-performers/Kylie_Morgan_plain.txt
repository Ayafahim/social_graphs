Kylie Morgan is an American country music singer-songwriter from Oklahoma signed to EMI Nashville.[1]


Background[edit]
Kylie Morgan began performing and touring full-time at the age of 14, and ultimately signed a recording contract with Universal Music Group Nashville, being assigned to the EMI Nashville imprint.[1] One of Morgan's early songs, "Phoebe", was written about teen suicide, and led to the singer touring schools across the United States to perform and talk about the impact of bullying, spearheaded by her own bullying prevention campaign.[2] She began sharing vulnerable songs on TikTok, and released a pair of EPs: Love, Kylie (2021) and P.S. (2022).[3] "If He Wanted to He Would" was issued to country radio as Morgan's debut single on July 25, 2022,[3] and became a top 40 hit on the Billboard Country Airplay and Hot Country Songs charts. It served as the lead single to her full-length debut project, Making It up as I Go, which was released on October 13, 2023.[1]
"Two Night Stands" was released on April 1, 2024, as Morgan's second single to country radio.[4]
