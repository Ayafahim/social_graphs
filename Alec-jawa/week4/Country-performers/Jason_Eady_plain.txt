American singer-songwriter
Jason Eady is an American singer and guitarist, originally from Mississippi but now based in Texas. He is affiliated with the Texas country music scene,[1] particularly through his evocation of an "old school honky-tonk" style of songwriting.[2]


Biography[edit]
Jason Eady grew up in Jackson, Mississippi,[3] and has been influenced by bluegrass, Don Williams and Willie Nelson.[4] He is married to, and frequently collaborates with, Texas singer-songwriter Courtney Patton.[5]
Eady collaborated with Kevin Welch on his last three albums, AM Country Heaven from 2012, Daylight and Dark from 2014, and his self-titled album from 2017.[4] AM Country Heaven debuted at number 40 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and number 9 on the Top Heatseekers chart.[6]
Highway Prayer: A Tribute to Adam Carroll, released on Austin-based Eight 30 Records in late 2016, featured Eady's take on Carroll's "Errol's Song." Additionally, Eight 30 Records' Floater: A Tribute to the Tributes to Gary Floater featured Eady's version of "Stand Back Boys I'm Fixing to Care.[7]

Reviews[edit]
AllMusic gave Daylight and Dark a 4 star review and said, "In terms of quality, it belongs on a shelf next to Dwight Yoakam's Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room, Joe Ely's Letter to Laredo, and yes, even Willie Nelson's Phases and Stages".[8] NPR's Ken Tucker contrasted Eady's traditionalism with Jon Pardi and said, "Ultimately, both Pardi and Eady have to confront the dilemma of all young country musicians: how to navigate the pop current that keeps country music commercially viable while connecting to a past that fewer and fewer listeners are aware of."[9]
