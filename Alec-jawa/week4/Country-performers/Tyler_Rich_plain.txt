Tyler Rich (born February 24, 1986) is an American country music singer. He was born Tyler Weinrich in Yuba City, California and began listening to country music at age eight. Rich began learning to play guitar at age 14 and, after graduating college, moved to Los Angeles, California. He self-released the single "Radio" in 2014. He also self-released a four-song extended play. After moving to Nashville, Tennessee, he was signed by Big Machine Records imprint Valory Music Group. The label issued his single "The Difference" in 2018.[1] "The Difference" has charted on Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay and was certified Platinum by Music Canada and Gold in the U.S. by RIAA. The song, written by Rhett Akins, Devin Dawson, Benjamin Burgess, and Jacob Durrett, was inspired by Rich's wife (then fiancée), Sabina Rich (Gadeki).[2] Rich began touring with Brett Young in late 2018.[3]
Tyler Rich's debut album "Two Thousand Miles" was released on September 4, 2020.  Tyler has amassed nearly half a billion global streams to date and notched three No. 1 hits on SiriusXM's The Highway with his debut album TWO THOUSAND MILES (The Valory Music Co.), featuring GOLD-certified “The Difference” plus subsequent releases “Better Than You’re Used To,” “A Little Bit of You” and “Trucks Don’t Lie.” In 2022, Tyler joined forces with one of Canada's most successful bilingual singer-songwriters, Marie-Mai for a duet on “Thinkin’ We’re In Love” in both English and French.[4]
