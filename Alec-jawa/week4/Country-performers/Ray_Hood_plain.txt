Ray Hood (born in Alabama[1]) is an American country music singer-songwriter. Hood co-wrote Doug Stone's 1994 top five single "Addicted to a Dollar."[2] Between 1996 and 2000, Hood charted two singles on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.[1] The highest-charting of the two, "Critical List," peaked at number 67 in 2000. It received a favorable review from Deborah Evans Price of Billboard, who wrote that "Hood has an impressive, barroom-seasoned baritone that works effectively on this uptempo number."[2] The follow-up single, "What's a Little More Water," also received a positive review from Price, who said that "all the elements are here–a stunning traditional country vocal, clean and crisp production, and a killer hook."[3]
His eponymous second album, released by Caption Records in October 2000, received a favorable review from Ray Waddell of Billboard, who wrote that "it's not often an artist comes along who can ease from heart-wrenching country ballads to gritty machismo so effortlessly and convincingly" and called the album "one of the most complete, solid country packages to come out of Nashville this year."[4] The album received a negative review from Tom Netherland of Country Standard Time, who said that "despite a strong baritone and Nashville's leading session men backing his dozen tracks, Hood simply veers too from the country fold."[5]
