Robyn Ottolini is a Canadian country singer and songwriter. She has released five extended plays as well as the platinum-certified single "F-150".[1][2]


Early life[edit]
Robyn Ottolini was raised in Uxbridge, Ontario[3] and began songwriting at the age of 13.[4] She cites Kacey Musgraves, Lennon & Maisy, and Sam Hunt as influences on her music.[4][5]

Career[edit]
In 2016, Ottolini was the second runner-up at the Boots and Hearts Music Festival’s Emerging Artist Showcase.[6] In February 2019, she independently released her debut EP Classic.[7] She was nominated for the Rising Star Award at the 2019 Country Music Association of Ontario Awards.[8]
In January 2020, Ottolini released the song "F-150".[9] The track was included on her February 2020 release The I'm Not Always Hilarious EP.[10] Towards the latter half of 2020, "F-150" gained traction on TikTok[11] and charted at #3 on the Rolling Stone Trending 25 chart in the United States for the week of October 1, 2020.[12][13] Amidst the success of the track, she signed a record deal with Warner Music Nashville.[14][15]
"F-150" impacted country radio formats on February 16, 2021,[16] and became her first Top 10 hit on the Billboard Canada Country chart,[17] and first gold-certified single in Canada.[18] In June 2021, Ottolini released her major-label debut project The But I'm Not Always Sad Either EP, which included the single "Tell You Everything".[19] Later that year, she won the "Rising Star" award at the 2021 Canadian Country Music Awards.[20]
In the spring of 2023, Ottolini departed Warner Nashville, and signed a distribution deal with Empire Distribution. She released the single "Match for My Memory" as part of her new deal.[21] On January 19, 2024, Ottolini released the extended play Growing Up to Do.[22]
