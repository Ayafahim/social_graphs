Mason Ramsey (born November 16, 2006)[1] is an American singer. In March 2018, after gaining Internet fame from a viral video of him yodeling "Lovesick Blues" by Hank Williams at a Walmart, Ramsey was signed to Big Loud.


Career[edit]
In March 2018, 11-year-old[2] Mason Ramsey, from Golconda, Illinois, was seen on camera singing "Lovesick Blues" in a Walmart store in Harrisburg, Illinois. Within a few days, videos of his performance collectively garnered over 25 million views and he became a viral sensation and internet meme.[3] Ramsey's performance sparked new interest in Hank Williams' 70-year-old recording of the song and in March Rolling Stone reported that Spotify's Viral 50 chart for the U.S. ranked Williams' "Lovesick Blues" at number three, and number four around the globe.
As a result of his newfound fame Ramsey made an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Saying that his dream was to appear on the Grand Ole Opry one day, DeGeneres surprised Ramsey by saying he had been booked for the following weekend.[4] On April 13, 2018, American DJ Whethan brought Ramsey out during his set at the 2018 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California.[5] In late April, he signed a record deal with Atlantic Records and Nashville-based label Big Loud.[6] His debut single "Famous" entered at number 62 on the US Billboard Hot 100,[7] while the EP debuted in the top 10 of Billboard's Heatseekers Albums chart at number 7.[8] Ramsey performed iconic number 1 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart's 60th anniversary; starting from the 1960s, he sang hit songs by Mariah Carey, Billy Joel, Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder, Celine Dion, The Monkees, The Jackson 5, Whitney Houston, Beyoncé, and Adele.[9] On June 8, 2018, he released his cover of "Lovesick Blues". On June 29, 2018, he released "Jambalaya (On the Bayou)" and "The Way I See It". On July 20, 2018, he released his debut extended play (EP), Famous. He was featured on Lil Nas X's third "Old Town Road" remix along with Billy Ray Cyrus and Young Thug,[10] and joined Lil Nas X on stage to perform it at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards.[11] In the same year, he was recognized as one of the YMCA's 15 under 15 for his contributions to country music.[12]
After a hiatus since 2019, he did a Burger King commercial in which he yodels about cow-based methane emissions in 2020.[13][14] Ramsey said he now plays basketball under the name Mason Blake, and that he plays on an outside court with friends.[15]
In 2022, Ramsey's song "Before I Knew It" from his 2019 EP Twang gained popularity on TikTok after he used it in several videos updating followers about his life, revealing he now works at Subway.[16]
On June 30, 2023, Ramsey released the single "Reasons to Come Home", his first new music release in nearly four years.[17] On August 4, 2023, Ramsey released his second single this year, "She Got It Outta Me", a month after the release of the first single.[18] On September 15, 2023, Ramsey released another song, "Next Right Thing", which, along with the previous two tracks released this year, included on his new EP.[19] All three songs released in 2023, along with two new songs "All I Wanna Be" and "Falls Into Place" were released as part of the new EP Falls Into Place on October 20, 2023, after four years from the release of the previous EP.[20] On November 10, 2023, Mason Ramsey released a Christmas country cover of the song "Run Rudolph Run".[21]
On January 26, 2024, Ramsey released a new single, "Here All Day", followed by "Blue Over You" released on February 23, 2024.[22][23] On April 26, 2024, Ramsey released his next single, "Something You Can Hold".[24] On June 20, 2024, Ramsey performed with Lana Del Rey at Fenway Park during her stadium tour debut. They performed a duet of "Blue Over You".[25] On June 28, 2024, Ramsey released two singles: "All The Way To Memphis" and "How Do I Know If I'm In Love".[26] Ramsey released his debut album I'll See You In My Dreams on September 20, 2024.[27]
