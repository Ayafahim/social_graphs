Amber Dotson (born in Garland, Texas[1]) is an American country music artist. Initially a songwriter for Sony/Tree Publishing, Dotson soon began singing demos as well. She also made an appearance on Travis Tritt's 2004 album My Honky Tonk History as a background vocalist.[2] George Strait heard some of the singer's demos, and asked her to join him on his 2005 tour, which also included Dierks Bentley.[3] Dotson was signed to Capitol Records Nashville in 2005, and although she released two singles for the label, she did not release an album.
