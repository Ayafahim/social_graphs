Herbert Raymond Pillow (July 4, 1937 – March 26, 2023) was an American country music singer, music publisher, and artists and repertoire (A&R) representative. In his career, he had 18 singles on the Billboard country songs chart, with his highest-peaking song being the number 9 single "I'll Take the Dog", a duet with Jean Shepard.[1] After charting for the last time in 1981, Pillow founded Sycamore Records with Larry McFadden,[1] and later worked in the A&R department of Capitol Records.
Pillow continued to perform as a member of the Grand Ole Opry and on popular classic country television programs such as Country's Family Reunion, which airs regularly in the United States on RFD-TV network.
Through his record label, Pillow released two albums, Ray Pillow Live and Country Class, the latter of which contained new material. Pillow retired in 2018.
Pillow was a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1966.[4][5]
Pillow died in Nashville, Tennessee, on March 26, 2023, at the age of 85.[6]
