Joel Richard Stephan Feeney (born November 21, 1957) is a Canadian country, pop music singer, songwriter and record producer.


History[edit]
Joel Feeney commenced his recording career with the pop rock band The Front.[1] Feeney was also a producer on albums by other Canadian country singers including Family Brown, and worked as a session musician before releasing his debut album Joel Feeney and the Western Front in 1991. The album included songs written by members of The Front.[2]
Feeney's second album Life Is but a Dream was released in 1993 and was produced by Chris Farren. It received a positive review from the Ottawa Citizen which called it a "soft-spoken but intense set of songs".[3]
His most successful hit came in 1995 with "What Kind of Man", which topped the Canadian RPM country singles charts. This song also came from Life Is but a Dream.[4] He is also notable for co-writing LeAnn Rimes' 2005 hit "Nothin' 'Bout Love Makes Sense".[5]
