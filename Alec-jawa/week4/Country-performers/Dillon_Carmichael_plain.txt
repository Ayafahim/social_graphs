Biography[edit]
Carmichael grew up in Burgin, Kentucky. He came from a musical family that included several other musicians, including two of his uncles: singers John Michael Montgomery and Eddie Montgomery, the latter a member of Montgomery Gentry.[3]
Carmichael began playing guitar at age twelve, and joined his friends at talent shows in his area. At age 17, he and his family were contacted by a representative of The Song Factory publishing company, who encouraged Carmichael to move to Nashville, Tennessee after he had graduated from high school. In 2018, he was recommended to record producer Dave Cobb, who produced Carmichael's debut album Hell on an Angel in 2018.[3] On August 21, 2018, Carmichael made his Grand Ole Opry debut.  He had spent a year and half as a security guard at the Opry from 2015-2016."[4] In addition to playing at the Grand Ole Opry, Carmichael has played multiple festivals and toured with Brooks & Dunn[5] and Lynyrd Skynyrd[6]
Rolling Stone Country described the album as "Featuring his signature booming baritone vocals and a sonic blend that mixes the hard-nosed Outlaw country with the melodic edge of Southern rock."[7] In 2020, Dillon charted on Country Airplay with the single release "I Do for You".[8]
