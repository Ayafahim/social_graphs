Redirect to:Kerchief#BandanaThis page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect:

From an alternative name: This is a redirect from a title that is another name or identity such as an alter ego, a nickname, or a synonym of the target, or of a name associated with the target.
This redirect leads to the title in accordance with the naming conventions for common names to aid searches and writing.  It is not necessary to replace these redirected links with a piped link.
If this redirect is an incorrect name for the target, then {{R from incorrect name}} should be used instead.


To a section: This is a redirect from a topic that does not have its own page to a section of a page on the subject. For redirects to embedded anchors on a page, use {{R to anchor}} instead.


Mentioned in a hatnote: This is a redirect from a title that is mentioned in a hatnote at the redirect target. The mention is usually atop the target article. It may, however, be directly under a section header, or in another article's hatnote (whenever the hatnote is under a section, {{R to section}} should also be used).
The titles of redirects mentioned in hatnotes may refer to a subject other than that of the target page. It is possible that this redirect may need to be retargeted, or become an article under its own title (see {{R with possibilities}}). If the title is a good candidate for a Wiktionary link, it may also be added.

When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
