Jacob Lyda (born May 18, 1975) is an American country music singer. His first four albums were produced by Mike Headrick for BGR Records/Country Discovery Records 1995–2003. He is now signed to Davis Music Group and is being promoted by Nine North Records. In early 2011, Lyda released his debut single "I'm Doin' Alright", which has charted on Hot Country Songs. Lyda co-wrote the song with Paul Overstreet.[2]
The song was to have been included on his album Another Song I Just Had to Write.[3]
Karlie Justus of Engine 145 gave the song a "thumbs up", saying that the song was "something greater than the sum of its parts". She praised its sound and the "charisma" in Lyda's voice.[4]
