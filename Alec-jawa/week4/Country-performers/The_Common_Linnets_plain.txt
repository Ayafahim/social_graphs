The Common Linnets in 2016
The Common Linnets are a Dutch band that was formed in 2013. The band originally consisted of Ilse DeLange and Waylon.[1] DeLange has stated that the group is a platform for Dutch artists to make country, Americana, and bluegrass music, and that the members will be changing. In May 2014, Waylon left the group and was replaced by American country singer Jake Etheridge.
Their song "Calm After the Storm", which is on their self-titled debut album, reached second place in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 and gave the Netherlands its best result since its last winning entry in 1975.


Name[edit]
Ilse de Lange and Waylon are both from the eastern part of the Netherlands. In Dutch, people from this region are sometimes called heikneuters, referring to the songbird kneu[2] or common linnet. The name for the band is an idea from Dutch designer Rens Dekker,[3] who is also responsible for the artwork design of their single and self-titled album.

Members[edit]
The band was originally composed of individual country artists Ilse DeLange and Waylon. However, Waylon stated that the band was created by Ilse and that she is, at the moment, the main leader. Ilse said that she created the band as a project or a "platform" for Dutch artists to make country, Americana or bluegrass music. Both artists stated that both artists can "be replaced" by other musicians.[4] Since May 2014 the band consists of Ilse DeLange, JB Meijers, Jake Etheridge and Matthew Crosby (also the writers of the hit song "Calm After The Storm").
Ilse DeLange was born on 13 May 1977 in Almelo, Netherlands. She started her career at the age of 8, and was later featured in regional and national talent shows in Hilversum. She formed a duo with guitarist Joop Liefland.[citation needed]
Waylon was born on 20 April 1980 in Apeldoorn, Netherlands. His stage name came from the name of his idol Waylon Jennings. After the Eurovision contest, the band went on a promotional tour in the Netherlands and some European countries. Fans however noted the absence of Waylon raising suspicion that he has left the group or even had been permanently replaced. Waylon wrote an article on his official Facebook website that "both members did not foresee the success of the band" and that he is currently occupied with his album that is going to be released in September 2014.[5][6]
JB Meijers was born on 10 June 1972 in Delft, Netherlands. Before joining the Common Linnets, Meijers played guitar in Dutch indie bands Charmin' Children, Shine and Supersub. He also played with De Dijk, Eboman and Acda & De Munnik and worked as a producer. Meijers replaced Waylon as the frontman of the band alongside DeLange. Meijers wrote the song Calm After the Storm.
Jake Etheridge was born on 25 April 1988 in Columbia, South Carolina.  Before joining the band, he uploaded several songs online.  Dividing his time between Nashville and the Netherlands, he joined the band in 2014, following Waylon's departure.[7]
