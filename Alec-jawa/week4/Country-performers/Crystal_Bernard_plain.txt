Crystal Lynn Bernard[1] (born September 30, 1961[2][1]) is an American singer-songwriter and actress, best known for her roles as Helen Chappel-Hackett on the sitcom Wings (1990–1997), Amy on It's a Living (1985–1989), and K.C. Cunningham on Happy Days (1983–1984).


Early life[edit]
Born in Garland, Texas to televangelist Jerry Wayne Bernard and teacher Gaylon Fussell,[1][3][4][5] Bernard became an entertainer at a young age, singing gospel songs with her older sister, Robyn (1959–2024), also an actress. One recording of the two that has survived from those years is a song called "The Monkey Song" on Feudin' Fussin' and Frettin' , recorded when Crystal was eight years old.[6] The recording is from a 1972 Thomas Road Baptist Church service led by Jerry Falwell. In addition to Robyn, she also has two younger sisters: Scarlett and Angelique Bernard.[citation needed]
Bernard studied acting at Alley Theatre while growing up in Houston, Texas. She attended Spring High School and continued her education at Baylor University,  studying acting and international relations.[7]

Career[edit]
Television[edit]
Bernard at the 1991 Emmy Awards
Bernard got her start in prime time television on the sitcom Happy Days, playing K.C. Cunningham during season 10 (1982–83). Then, after various guest appearances on other series, she joined the cast of the resurrected, syndicated version of the sitcom It's a Living,[8] playing waitress Amy Tompkins. In 1989, she starred in a television pilot, Chameleons, created by Glen A. Larson. She played Shelley, a self-proclaimed crazed heiress who discovers that her eccentric millionaire uncle Jason Carr has been murdered. She sets out on a quest to find the truth behind his murder.
She played strong-willed airport lunch counter operator and cellist Helen Chappel Hackett on the sitcom Wings for the series entire eight season duration (1990–97). In 1999, she starred in the television movie To Love, Honor and Betray opposite David Cubitt and James Brolin.

Early in her film career, she appeared in Young Doctors in Love (1982), along with her Happy Days co-star Ted McGinley. She starred in Deborah Brock's Roger Corman-produced horror film Slumber Party Massacre 2 (1987).
Later, her work included a role in the film Jackpot (2001) and starring roles in Welcome to Paradise (2007) and Grave Misconduct (2008). She also starred in two Hallmark Channel movies, Single Santa Seeks Mrs. Claus (2004) and its sequel, Meet the Santas (2005).

Theatre[edit]
Bernard has appeared in these stage productions since the end of Wings:

Music[edit]
In addition to acting, Bernard has a music career as a singer-songwriter. Albums include The Girl Next Door (1996) and Don't Touch Me There (1999). The latter includes a gospel track she recorded with her father and one sung with country artist Billy Dean.  The single "Don't Touch Me There" peaked at No. 25 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.
She co-wrote the song "If I Were Your Girl" with Rhett Lawrence, which appeared on Paula Abdul's album Head over Heels (1995).  She also co-wrote the song "Come To Me" on the debut self titled album of Angie & Debbie Winans (1993).
Bernard sang a duet with Peter Cetera called "(I Wanna Take) Forever Tonight", released on Cetera's album One Clear Voice (1995).  The single peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart and No. 86 on the Hot 100.
