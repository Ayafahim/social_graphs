Biography[edit]
Miller was born in Surrey, British Columbia.[3] He liked acting when he was younger, before he began to play the guitar.[4] In 2019, Miller won the BC Country Music Association's Ray McAuley Horizon Award.[5] Miller cites Brad Paisley, Alan Jackson, Kenny Rogers, George Strait, and Garth Brooks as influences on his music.[6][7]
On Christmas Day 2019, Miller released his debut single "Pillow Talkin'".[5][8] The song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Canada Country chart, making Miller the first independently signed artist to top the chart with his debut single.[1] It also became Miller's first Gold-certified single.[9] In June 2020, Miller released his second single "I Would Be Over Me Too".[10][11] Miller was then selected as a semi-finalist in the SiriusXM Top of the Country competition.[12] In October, "I Would Be Over Me Too" would also reach No. 1 on the Canada Country chart, handing Miller his second consecutive chart-topper, and first as a songwriter.[13] In November 2020, Miller released his debut extended play Sometimes I Don't, But Sometimes I Do, which featured his first two singles as well as his the singles, "Fighting"[14][3][15] and "Sometimes I Do".[16] In November 2021, Miller was named the winner of the SiriusXM "Top of the Country" competition.[17]
He followed that up with the release of "Never Met a Beer" in August 2022, a collaboration with fellow Canadian country artist Matt Lang.[18] In February 2023, he released the single "Back to Drinkin' Whiskey".[19] In April 2023, Miller released the track "I Know Jack", which was later included on his acoustic extended play The Band's Packed Up that was released on May 19, 2023.[20][21] The tracks from the extended play were included on Miller's album Spillin' My Truth, released on August 25, 2023.[22] The album also includes the single "Shoulda Known Better".[23]
In January 2024, Miller signed a management deal with RLive, a division of Republic Live, as their flagship signing.[24] In February 2024, he signed a distribution deal with The Orchard, and released the single "Broken Man" in March 2024.[25] In the spring of 2024, Miller embarked on "The Country Mixtape Tour" across Canada as a co-headliner alongside Shawn Austin and Andrew Hyatt.[26] In August 2024, he released the single "What Good Is a Memory".[27]
