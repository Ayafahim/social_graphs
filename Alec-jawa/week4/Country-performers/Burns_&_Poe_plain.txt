Burns & Poe was an American country music duo composed of Keith Burns and Michelle Poe. The duo was founded in 2007 after Burns left the group Trick Pony. Poe was once a solo artist for DreamWorks Nashville, and later played bass guitar for Dierks Bentley and Hank Williams Jr.[1] The two met in 2007 while Burns was holding auditions to recruit a new lead singer for Trick Pony after Aubrey Collins (who had replaced original lead singer Heidi Newfield just months earlier) left.[2]
They released a two-disc, self-titled album in late 2010 through their website, followed by a Christmas single titled "Hear the Angels Singing" in November of that year.[3] Blue Steel Records gave it a wide release in 2011. The same year, Music Row magazine awarded them as Independent Artist of the Year.[4][5] They promoted the dual album on tour in 2011.[6] Alex Henderson of Allmusic rated the album 3 stars out of 5, saying that "they sound like they genuinely enjoy working together".[7]
Later in 2011, Burns & Poe released a video for a fourth song, "I Need a Job".[8] In 2014, Burns rejoined Trick Pony.[9]
