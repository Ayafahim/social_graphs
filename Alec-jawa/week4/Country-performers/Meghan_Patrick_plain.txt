Patrick was nominated for Songwriter of the Year with co-writer Chad Kroeger at the 2016 Canadian Country Music Association Awards for her song "Bow Chicka Wow Wow".[10]
In 2016 Patrick was part of the advertising campaign for a new line of Roots Canada clothing.[11]
Patrick has shared the stage with Lady Antebellum,[12] Dwight Yoakam,[13] Jon Pardi[14] Kip Moore,[15] and Gord Bamford.
In 2017, she supported Tom Cochrane on his 25th anniversary tour for his album Mad Mad World. In 2018 she performed in Halifax, Nova Scotia at the Marquee Ballroom.[16]
In June 2021, she released her third studio album, Heart on My Glass. It was her debut American release and included the singles "My First Car" and "Never Giving Up on You",[17] as well as "Cool About It".[18] Patrick made her Grand Ole Opry Debut on April 11, 2023.[19]

Personal life[edit]
Patrick is married to fellow singer Mitchell Tenpenny.[20] She is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States, and was born to a Canadian father and an American mother.[1]
