Tommy Cash (April 5, 1940 – September 13, 2024) was an American country musician. His elder brother was Johnny Cash.


Background and career[edit]
Cash was born in Dyess, Arkansas, on April 5, 1940,[1] the youngest of four sons and three daughters of Ray and Carrie (Rivers) Cash (one of whom was Johnny Cash, born eight years earlier). He formed his first band in high school. After high-school graduation, he enlisted in the United States Army, and worked as a disc jockey for the Armed Forces Radio network.[1]
After the Army, Cash played with Hank Williams Jr., and eventually gained a record deal from Musicor Records in 1965. A year later, he joined United Artists Records and just missed the Country Top 40 in 1968 with "The Sounds of Goodbye."
In late 1969, while on Epic Records, he delivered his biggest hit, a tune dedicated to John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr., titled "Six White Horses".[1] In 1970, he had a pair of top-10 singles, "One Song Away" and "Rise and Shine", written by Carl Perkins.[1] Cash's final top-20 hit, "I Recall a Gypsy Woman", was released in 1973.[1]
Cash also acted in the 2016 film The River Thief. He continued to tour until at least late 2016.[2]

Other interests[edit]
Cash was a licensed realtor in Tennessee, and an agent with Crye-Leike Real Estate Services in Nashville. He was listing agent for the sale of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash's home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, after they both died in 2003.[3]

Death[edit]
Cash died on September 13, 2024, at the age of 84.[4]
