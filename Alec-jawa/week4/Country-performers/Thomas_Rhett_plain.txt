Thomas Rhett Akins Jr. was born in Valdosta, Georgia,[1] to mother Paige (née Braswell) and father Rhett Akins. Rhett Akins had hit singles in the 1990s with "That Ain't My Truck" and "Don't Get Me Started" before becoming a songwriter at the beginning of the 21st century.[9]
He was raised in Hendersonville, Tennessee.[10] He grew up knowing other singers including Tim McGraw and Brooks & Dunn.[11] He has one younger sister,[12] and two younger half-brothers; one on his mother's side, and one his father's side.[13]
After learning to play drums while attending junior high school, Rhett later would go onstage with his father and play. In high school, he was part of a band named The High Heeled Flip Flops.[14]  Rhett went to  Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee, to study communications.[15] He dropped out of college when he was 20 to pursue a career in music.[16] He subsequently accepted a publishing deal by Big Machine Label Group to write songs.[11]

Career[edit]
Songwriting[edit]
Rhett co-wrote the song "I Ain't Ready to Quit" on Jason Aldean's 2010 album My Kinda Party and signed a recording contract with Big Machine Records' Valory Music Group division in 2011.[17] The album's first 21 weeks were spent in the top 40 of the Billboard 200; it also has sold 1.7 million in its first years of release.[18] 
Rhett also co-wrote the 2013 singles "1994" by Jason Aldean, "Parking Lot Party" by Lee Brice, and "Round Here" by Florida Georgia Line. During the chart week of September 21, 2013, the Country Airplay chart included five songs within the top 10 that Rhett or his father had co-written, including "It Goes Like This".[19]

His debut album, also titled It Goes Like This, was released on October 29, 2013.[20] The album's fourth single, "Get Me Some of That", became Rhett's second number 1 single in early 2014. The album's fifth single, "Make Me Wanna", was released to country radio on August 4, 2014. It reached number one on the Country Airplay chart on March 7, 2015. In between the two singles, Rhett sang guest vocals along with Justin Moore on Brantley Gilbert's "Small Town Throwdown".
