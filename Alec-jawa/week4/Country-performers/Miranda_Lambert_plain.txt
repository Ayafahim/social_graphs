Miranda Leigh Lambert (born November 10, 1983) is an American country singer, songwriter and guitarist. Born in Longview, Texas, she started out in early 2001 when she released her self-titled debut album independently. In 2003, she finished in third place on the television program Nashville Star, a singing competition which aired on the USA Network. Outside her solo career, she is a member of the Pistol Annies, a group she formed in 2011 alongside Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley. Lambert has been honored by the Grammy Awards, the Academy of Country Music Awards and the Country Music Association Awards. Lambert has been honored with more Academy of Country Music Awards than any artist in history and was named by the Chicago Tribune as the "greatest country music artist of all time" in 2019. [3]
Lambert's second and major-label debut album Kerosene (2005) was certified Platinum in the United States and produced the singles "Me and Charlie Talking", "Bring Me Down", "Kerosene" and "New Strings". All four singles reached the top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs. Her second album, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, was released in early 2007. Three of its singles ("Famous in a Small Town", "Gunpowder & Lead" and "More Like Her") peaked within the top 20 on the country songs chart, with "Gunpowder & Lead" becoming her first top 10 entry in July 2008. Her third album, Revolution, was released in September 2009. Two of its songs – "The House That Built Me" and "Heart Like Mine" – topped the Hot Country Songs chart. 
2011's Four the Record included the singles "Baggage Claim", "Over You", "Fastest Girl in Town", "Mama's Broken Heart" and "All Kinds of Kinds". Lambert released her fifth album, Platinum, in 2014.[4] The record won the Grammy Award for Best Country Album, and the album's lead single "Automatic" reached the top five on the Country charts.[5] Her sixth studio album, The Weight of These Wings, was released on November 18, 2016, and subsequently certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[6] Her seventh studio album, Wildcard, was released on November 1, 2019, and went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Country Album in early 2021. Three singles from the album ("It All Comes out in the Wash", "Bluebird", "Settling Down") reached the top 20 of the country music charts, and the album's second official single "Bluebird" became Lambert's first song to top the Billboard Country Airplay Chart as a solo artist since 2012.
She later collaborated with singer-songwriters Jon Randall and Jack Ingram for the album The Marfa Tapes, departing from her usual sound and opting for an acoustic, stripped-back feel. It was released on May 7, 2021 to acclaim from critics. Lambert released her eighth solo album Palomino on April 29, 2022. The same year she was listed on 100 Most Influential People by Time.[7]


Early life[edit]
Miranda Leigh Lambert was born November 10, 1983,[1] to Rick and Bev (née Hughes) Lambert in Longview, Texas,[2] and was raised in Lindale, Texas. She was named after her great-grandmother, Lucy Miranda.[8] She has one younger brother.[9]
Her parents met while Bev was attending camp at Southern Methodist University and Rick was an on-campus undercover narcotics officer, and they got together a few years later. Rick is a former Dallas police officer who played in a country-rock group called Contraband in the 1970s.[10] Rick and Bev later became private detectives and even worked on the high-profile case of the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. After the oil crisis dampened the economy in Texas, her family lost everything.[11]
After the downturn, things got better and her parents began a faith-based ministry and offered their home as a shelter for the victims of domestic violence and their children. Miranda has said that this experience fueled her music and that her song "Gunpowder & Lead" is a reflection of that.[12]
While still in high school, Lambert made her professional singing debut with "The Texas Pride Band".[13] She also fronted the house band at the Reo Palm Isle[14] in Longview, Texas, a long-running venue that had presented legends such as Elvis Presley and Willie Nelson, and the place where Brooks & Dunn started out as the house band.[citation needed]

Music career[edit]
2000–2003: Career beginnings, self-titled debut album, and Nashville Star[edit]

At 16, Lambert appeared on the Johnnie High Country Music Revue in Arlington, Texas, the same talent show that had helped launch the career of LeAnn Rimes. Lambert then acquired a recording session in Nashville, Tennessee, but left the studio after she became frustrated with the "pop" type of music presented to her. She went back to Texas in 2000 and asked her father to teach her how to play guitar, so she could write her own songs.[15][16] In 2001, she released her self-titled debut album which consisted of 10 tracks.[17]
In 2002, Dusty Meador hired Lambert to perform at Tye Phelps' country music restaurant and venue Love and War in Texas. Lambert continued to perform around the Texas Music Scene opening for Cooder Graw, Kevin Fowler, and Jack Ingram. In 2003, she auditioned for the talent competition Nashville Star, where she earned a third-place finish behind Buddy Jewell and John Arthur Martinez.[18] During her 9-week stay on Nashville Star, Lambert caught the attention of the show's judge and Sony Music executive, Tracy Gershon, who later convinced the label to sign her.

2004–2008: Kerosene and Crazy Ex- Girlfriend[edit]
On September 15, 2003, she signed with Epic Records.[19] Her debut single, "Me and Charlie Talking", co-written by her father and Heather Little, was released in summer of 2004 as the lead single to her debut album, titled Kerosene. The album comprised 12 songs, 11 of which she wrote or co-wrote. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Country Albums charts,[20] and eventually gained a Platinum certification by the RIAA for shipments of over one million copies,[21] selling more than 930,000 copies up to July 2008.[22] Overall, the album produced four Top 40 singles on the Billboard country charts, including the title track which was a Top 20 hit. Lambert also toured with Keith Urban[23] and George Strait[24] in early 2006. In 2007, she toured with Dierks Bentley and Toby Keith. On Thursday, August 7,2007

Lambert's second album, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, was released on May 1, 2007. She wrote eight of the album's 11 tracks,[26] including its four singles. Much of the track "Gunpowder & Lead", the album's third single and her highest-charting single, was written while she was taking a concealed-carry handgun class in her home town.[27] Fady Joudah of The New Yorker said the album proved "she has talent and charisma on a par with Dolly Parton, another blond beauty who was once underestimated."[28]
In 2005, at the 40th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards in Las Vegas, Lambert won the CoverGirl "Fresh Face of Country Music Award". She was also nominated for the Country Music Association's Horizon Award in 2005; in 2007, Lambert also received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for her single "Kerosene".

I still don't. I don't want to be an actress. I just wanted to be on that show mainly so I could be a groupie [for their autographs]."[44]
Late in 2012, Lambert appeared on Shelton's Christmas album Cheers, It's Christmas, to which she contributed guest vocals on a version of "Jingle Bell Rock".

Written by Lambert, Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne, it was her first song released since Platinum.[51] In September, Lambert announced her sixth studio album, The Weight of These Wings, which was released on November 18, 2016. She was selected as one of 30 artists to perform on "Forever Country", a mashup track of "Take Me Home, Country Roads", "On the Road Again" and "I Will Always Love You" which celebrated 50 years of the CMA Awards.[52] Shortly after the release of The Weight of These Wings, the Highway Vagabond Tour was announced[53] and began on January 24, 2017.

2019–2020: Wildcard[edit]
Lambert announced that the lead-off single from her seventh studio album would be "It All Comes Out in the Wash", which was released on July 18, 2019.[56] The song was co-written by Lambert with Hillary Lindsey, Lori McKenna, and Liz Rose ("Love Junkies") and produced by Jay Joyce, marking the first time she had worked with the producer.[57] The song was released alongside "Locomotive", another track intended for the upcoming album that she had previously debuted on the CMA Music Festival in June 2019.[58] Two other tracks—"Mess with My Head" and "Bluebird"—were also previewed ahead of the album in August 2019.[59][60]
Lambert's seventh studio album, Wildcard, was released on November 1, 2019.[61] In promotion of the album, Lambert announced the 27-date Wildcard Tour, which was set to begin on January 16, 2020, and run through May 9, 2020, but which had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Several solo acoustic live performances of "Bluebird" premiered on her Instagram and YouTube channels during this time, and she performed the song at the belated and socially-distanced 2020 ACMs,[62] at which she won an award for Music Event of the Year for her collaboration with other female country artists, "Fooled Around and Fell in Love".

The album Wildcard went on to be nominated for both ACM and CMA Album of the Year, and won the 2021 Grammy for the Best Country Album on 15 March.[65] She performed "Bluebird" at the awards ceremony.

2021–2022: The Marfa Tapes, Palomino, and Pistol Annies Christmas Album[edit]
Lambert hinted at an upcoming project with longtime friends and collaborators Jon Randall and Jack Ingram via her social media accounts on March 2, 2021, before announcing their upcoming collaborative acoustic record The Marfa Tapes in the following days, to be released on May 7. The tracklist was announced, with Lambert's previously recorded songs "Tin Man" and "Tequila Does" both set to be featured on the album, and the first new song In His Arms was premiered with a video on March 5.[66] The album was recorded in Marfa, Texas towards the end of 2020 with just two microphones and two acoustic guitars, and was said to have an unpolished feel, with one-take recordings retaining mistakes and snapshots of conversations between the three, and the sound of the campfire and the desert in the background. It would contain 15 songs the three singer-songwriters had written together over a period of six years, beginning in July 2015.
In His Arms was performed live by Lambert, Randall and Ingram at the 2021 ACM Awards, and at the awards show Lambert also performed "Drunk (And I Don't Wanna Go Home)" with Elle King, and she also stood in last-minute for Chris Stapleton's wife Morgane Stapleton to sing harmony on Stapleton's performance of Maggie's Song.
The new recording of "Tin Man", alongside previously unheard tracks "Am I Right or Amarillo"[67] and "Geraldene"[68] were also pre-released before the album's release on May 7, and the trio performed "Geraldene" live on The Ellen Show later in the month.[69] Around this time, Miranda Lambert replied to a comment regarding her band the Pistol Annies in the comments section of her Instagram post, fuelling speculation that a new Pistol Annies project might be in the works for 2021. Lambert subsequently revealed that she "didn't do much in the beginning of 2020. [She] just sort of enjoyed the break... And then in the last six months or so [she] kind of worked overtime to make up for lost time",[70] and that an upcoming solo record was therefore in the works. She commented in the same article that she was considering re-recording several tracks from The Marfa Tapes for this record, including "In His Arms" and "Geraldene", and potentially other personal favourites, such as "Waxahachie".[70]
The trio announced that alongside the record, they would be released 'The Marfa Tapes' film on Lambert's Facebook page to be available for 24 hours from May 8, which would feature acoustic performances from the record alongside interviews and behind-the-scenes footage from the recording process of the album.[71]
The Marfa Tapes album was released to critical acclaim on May 7, with critics applauding Lambert's musical risk-taking and the simple but effective songwriting. Pitchfork commented, "Somewhere between a demo collection, a live album with no audience, and a lo-fi left turn, this music is a joy to hear, like a vacation on record",[72] and Variety questioned whether this might even be Lambert's best record so far, "And like her bigger, broader sounding albums, she gives as good as she gets, quietly, while sounding as grand as if she had a studio band's excess at work."[73] The film premiered on Lambert's Facebook page on May 8, featuring original songs not previously seen and not included on The Marfa Tapes, the first of which was "Tornado" — co-written by Lambert, Randall and Ingram — and also a Lambert solo-written piece, "They've Closed Down the Honky-Tonks".
In the week following the album's release, the trio performed lead single "In His Arms" once more, on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.
On October 15, she released the lead single from her upcoming studio album, "If I Was A Cowboy", on October 15. The song's first video was uploaded to YouTube on October 15, and a later official video was uploaded to YouTube on January 12, 2022. The single has been a moderate hit on the country singles charts, so far reaching the top 20 of both the Country Airplay Chart and the Hot Country Songs Chart.
The Pistol Annies announced the release of their first Christmas album, Hell of a Holiday, which was released October 22, 2021.[74] It contains 10 original songs, a cover of Merle Haggard's "If We Make It Through December", popular Christmas classic "Sleigh Ride", and traditional New Year's song "Auld Lang Syne".[74] The album was well-received for its original content, and Billboard praised their cover of "If We Make It Through December" as "One of the most striking moments on Hell of a Holiday".[75] They performed many of the songs and discussed the album on December 15's "The Pistol Annies Hell of a Holiday Special", which was made available on Facebook.[76]
On December 30, 2021, Lambert released "Y'all Means All" in support of the LGBTQ community. The song was used in the trailer for the sixth season of Queer Eye.[77]
In March 2022 she won Entertainer of the Year at the American Country Music Awards.[78]
Lambert and Elle King's 2021 collaboration "Drunk (And I Don't Wanna Go Home)" was certified platinum in February, and the two performed the song together at the Ryman Auditorium on Feb 28th to celebrate.[79] The single has so far reached the top 10 of the country charts.
Lambert released a teaser for a new song titled "Strange" ahead of the ACM Awards, which were held on March 7 in Vegas. She was nominated for 5 awards, marking her record-breaking 16th nomination for Female Vocalist of the Year, and she won Video of the Year for "Drunk (And I Don't Wanna Go Home)", and as well as the top prize of the night, Entertainer of the Year, for the first time in her career.[80] This brings her tally of total ACM Awards won to 37, the most of all time, and also meant that she is eligible for the ACM's rare and coveted Triple Crown Award.[81]
On March 10, Lambert released "Strange" alongside a video on her YouTube channel, and announced her ninth solo studio album, Palomino, which was released on April 29.[82] The album includes "If I Was a Cowboy" and "Strange", alongside three re-recorded tracks from her 2021 Marfa Tapes album with Jon Randall and Jack Ingram: "Geraldene", "In His Arms", and "Waxahachie".[83]
Lambert headlined Europe's largest country music festival, C2C: Country 2 Country, from March 11–13, 2022, marking her first performances in the UK/Europe since her headlining tour there in 2017. She performed two songs from Palomino live for the first time ever at her London show on March 11, her single "If I Was a Cowboy" and "Actin' Up".[84]
