Bill LaBounty is an American musician. He was initially a singer-songwriter in the soft rock genre.[2] As a solo artist, LaBounty recorded six studio albums, including four on Curb/Warner Bros. Records. His first charting single, "This Night Won't Last Forever", was covered in 1979 by Michael Johnson, whose rendition was a top 20 pop hit that year, and eventually also covered by the country group Sawyer Brown in the early 2000s.
LaBounty was born in Wisconsin and raised in Idaho. He attended Boise State University where he founded his first band Fat Chance, which recorded one album for RCA Records.[1]
In the mid-1980s, LaBounty shifted his focus to country music and has co-written several songs for country music artists, including Steve Wariner's number one hits "Lynda", "The Weekend" and "I Got Dreams".[3] LaBounty signed to a songwriting contract with Curb Publishing in 2001.[4] Many of his songs were written with his wife, Beckie Foster.[5]
