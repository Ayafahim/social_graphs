Career[edit]
The Voice (2013)[edit]
Main article: The Voice (American TV series) season 4
During the blind auditions of The Voice on March 25, 2013, Bradbery performed Taylor Swift's "Mean", prompting Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, and Usher to turn their chairs. Bradbery then chose Shelton and remained on his team. At the Battle rounds, Bradbery faced Caroline Glaser where they sang the song "Put Your Records On", Bradbery was chosen over Glaser, in the process advanced to the Knockout rounds. During the Knockouts, Bradbery sang "Jesus Take The Wheel" against Taylor Beckham in which Blake selected her to remain in the competition, sending home Beckham. During the Top 16 show, she sang "Maybe It Was Memphis" and was voted through by America into the next week. The following week, the country singer sang a rendition of Carrie Underwood's song "Wasted". During the Top 10 playoffs, Bradbery sang a rendition of "Heads Carolina, Tails California", which became the first song of the season, and only song of that round, to reach the iTunes top 10 charts.[5]
During the Top 8, Bradbery sang a rendition of "Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)". In the Top 6, she sang Pam Tillis' "Shake the Sugar Tree" chosen by coach Blake Shelton. That week, she also sang Sara Evans' "A Little Bit Stronger", ending the song with a high note through the final "stronger" and "yeah" run. During the Top 5, Bradbery sang "Please Remember Me" and "Who I Am" which reached 6 and 4 spots respectively on the iTunes top 10 charts. During "Who I Am", she walked out through the audience to sing beside her parents and stepmother.[5] At the finals, Bradbery sang the song "Timber, I'm Falling in Love" along with her coach Blake Shelton, she also re-sang the song "Maybe It Was Memphis" which reached the iTunes top 10 charts and sang the song "Born to Fly" before she was announced as the winner of season four of The Voice.[5] She had the most peak positions and most singles to reach the top 10 on iTunes during the season. Overall, she had more iTunes downloads than any other contestant in the show's history.[citation needed] At age 16, Bradbery was the youngest winner of The Voice at the time.[6][7] This record was later eclipsed by Sawyer Fredericks (who won Season Eight at age 16),[8][9] and later by Brynn Cartelli (who won season 14 at age 15).[10] and Carter Rubin (who won season 19 at age 15).

2013–2014: Danielle Bradbery[edit]
On June 19, 2013, the day after Bradbery won The Voice, she was signed to a record deal with Big Machine Records.[11] Her debut single, "The Heart of Dixie", was released on July 16, 2013.[12] Bradbery's first studio album, self-titled Danielle Bradbery, was released November 25, 2013.[13][14][15] On September 14, 2013, Bradbery performed on the WGTY Great Country Radio stage at the York Fair and sang four songs from her upcoming album, which were "Young in America", "Dance Hall", "Never Like This" and "Daughter of a Working Man".[16] Bradbery made her Grand Ole Opry debut on the historic stage of the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville on November 12.[17] Along with her Opry debut, Bradbery was the supporting act on Brad Paisley's Beat This Summer Tour.[17] On November 17, 2013, Bradbery sang the national anthem at the opening ceremonies of the 2013 Formula 1 United States Grand Prix.[18] Her song "My Day" was featured in the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics as she was chosen to be "the voice" of the Games' promotional campaign that partners NBC Olympics with The Voice.[19]
Bradbery joined Hunter Hayes as a special guest on his We're Not Invisible Tour starting March 20, 2014.[20]

2015–2018: Singles and I Don't Believe We've Met[edit]
In an interview with Naked Mag published in February 2015, Bradbery said she was writing songs for her second album and was hoping to release it sometime that year.[21]
She announced on her Twitter account on August 23, 2015 that she would be releasing the first single from her second studio album "Friend Zone" on August 28, 2015. The song never had an official terrestrial radio release and was a "buzz" single.[citation needed]
In 2017, Bradbery finally released a song called "Sway" as a single. It debuted at No. 46 on the Billboard country chart the week on June 14 and it officially impacted country radio on August 28, 2017. She also shifted to Big Machine's BMLG imprint to accompany the release. On August 4, 2017, Bradbery announced that "Sway" would be the lead single off her upcoming second album, I Don't Believe We've Met, which was released on December 1, 2017.[22] "Worth It" was the second single. Finally, "Goodbye Summer" was re-recorded as a music video with Thomas Rhett, with whom she released the single "Playing with Fire". She, Thomas Rhett, and Nick Jonas sang "Closer" at the CMA awards.
In 2018, she focused on recording covers for her fans, including "Psycho", "Slow Burn", and "God Is a Woman", as well as "Set Fire to the Rain" and others.

2019-2022: In Between, The Collection[edit]
In 2019, she appeared on the Charlie's Angels: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, contributing the song "Blackout".[23] She released a music video with Parker McCollum, a cover of "Shallow", and recorded "Hometown" with Zac Brown of Zac Brown Band and Diplo for his first country album, Snake Oil (album). She also was featured on PUBLIC's song "Make You Mine".
In 2020, she released 3 songs during the COVID-19 pandemic, including "Never Have I Ever", based on her partner,[24] "Girls In My Hometown", and a cover of Christmas song "O Holy Night".
In 2021, she recorded and released a version of her song "Never Have I Ever" titled "Never Have I Ever/Yo Nunca He... (Spanish Version)" with Mexican artist KURT. She filmed promo for her next single, also released in 2021 named "Stop Draggin' Your Boots" which became a certified RIAA Gold single in 2023.[25] Additionally, she was featured on Parker McCollum's album Gold Chain Cowboy on the ballad named "Dallas".
In 2022, she released piano ballad "Break My Heart Again" about the ups and downs of relationships,[26] and rounded out the year by releasing a collection of songs named In Between: The Collection, that she had made since 2019 with the intention of showing her journey as an artist and putting together these songs as closure before moving into a new project.[27] The collection also included never-before released songs such as "Look at the Mess I'm In" and a cover of Robyn Ottolini's song "F-150". She also released live acoustic versions of both "Stop Draggin' Your Boots" and "Break My Heart Again".

2023-Present: Singles and Danielle[edit]
At the end of 2022, after talking about moving into a new era of music, Danielle released "A Special Place". Written by Maren Morris, Sasha Alex Sloan, Shane McAnally, and Jimmy Robbins, it is a spunky breakup song about a person you do not wish well.[28]
In 2023 she announced and began her first headlining tour, the A Special Place Tour supporting her song "A Special Place".[29] After performing her next singles on that tour, "Monster" was released on April 28, followed by Runaways on June 9th during the 50th CMA Fest and finally, "The Day That I'm Over You" on September 1. Additionally, she collaborated with Jordan Davis (singer) on song "Midnight Crisis" off of his album Bluebird Days.
In 2024, she released 3 songs in 7 weeks, possibly hinting at a new album. "Younger and Wiser" released on April 19, after being teased on Bradbery's social media pages. 3 weeks later, "Wedding or a Funeral" was released on May 10, hinting on social media that things did not end well in Bradbery's last relationship.[30] 4 weeks later, Bradbery released "Broken Boy" on June 7. At a concert in Nashville, TN, Bradbery announced her third studio album, Danielle, her first independent release, on September 6, 2024.[31]

Artistry[edit]
Bradbery cites Carrie Underwood, Taylor Swift, Miranda Lambert, and Martina McBride as her musical influences.[32][33]

Philanthropy[edit]
On October 12, 2013, Bradbery performed "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" at the Eighth Annual Tradition of Hope Gala to support MDA's Augie's Quest which has the sole purpose of finding a cure for ALS.[34] She also performed at the Girls & Guitars charity concert to benefit the Ryan Seacrest Foundation.[35] Bradbery and many other country stars signed a Honey Nut Cheerios box to be auctioned off for charity Outnumber Hunger. The charity's purpose is stop hunger in the U.S.[36]
