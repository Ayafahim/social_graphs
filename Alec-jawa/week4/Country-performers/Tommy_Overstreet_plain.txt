Early life[edit]
Born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States,[1] Overstreet grew up in both Houston and Abilene, Texas.[1] He decided on a singing career when he was young, influenced largely by his cousin, "Uncle" Gene Austin.[4][5] Austin was a singing star of the 1920s and 1930s.

Overstreet made frequent guest appearances on the TV variety show Hee Haw.[1][7][6] His highest charting Billboard hit was 1972's "Ann (Don't Go Runnin')", which went to number two.[1]
His other top-20 hits were "I Don't Know You Anymore" (number five in 1971), "Heaven is My Woman's Love" (number three in 1972), "Send Me No Roses" (number seven in 1973); "I'll Never Break These Chains" (number seven in 1973), "(Jeannie Marie) You Were a Lady" (number seven in 1974), "If I Miss You Again Tonight" (number eight in 1974), "I'm a Believer" (number 9 in 1975), "That's When My Woman Begins" (number six in 1975), "If Love was a Bottle of Wine" (number 11 in 1976), "Don't Go City Girl on Me" (number five in 1977), "Yes, Ma'am" (number 12 in 1978), and "Fadin' In, Fadin' Out" (number 11 in 1978).[1]
