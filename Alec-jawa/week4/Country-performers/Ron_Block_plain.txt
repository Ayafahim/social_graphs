Ronald Franklin Block (born July 30, 1964) is an American banjo player, guitarist, and singer-songwriter, best known as a member of the bluegrass band Alison Krauss & Union Station. He has won 14 Grammy Awards, 6 International Bluegrass Music Awards, a Country Music Association Award, and a Gospel Music Association Dove Award.[1]


Biography[edit]
Ron Block heard a variety of music at an early age because his father owned a music store, Hogan's House of Music, in southern California. At home he was drawn to the bluegrass music of Bill Monroe, J. D. Crowe, and The Stanley Brothers. At the age of 13, after seeing Earl Scruggs on TV, he learned to play the banjo. In his teens he also learned acoustic and electric guitar. Later in his career, he recorded a solo album of instrumentals, titled Hogan's House of Music (2015), dedicated to the music store where he spent much of his youth.[2]
In the 1980s, he co-founded the band Weary Hearts, which included Eric Uglum, Butch Baldassari, and Mike Bub, then played with the Lynn Morris Band before joining Union Station in October 1991. During his career, he has also recorded solo albums, produced, and performed on albums by Dolly Parton, Clint Black, Brad Paisley, and Bill Frisell.[3]
Block has written songs for Union Station and for his own solo albums. His songs have been recorded by Randy Travis, Rhonda Vincent, Michael W. Smith, and The Cox Family.[3] Block names as two of his favorites "A Living Prayer" and "There is a Reason," both recorded with Alison Krauss & Union Station, both dealing with his Christian faith.[4]
