Mitchell's first major film role was at age 15 in The Crow: City of Angels, playing teenaged drug addict Grace. During the filming of the 1996 movie, she unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Mary Camden in the new family drama, 7th Heaven. She then read for the part of sister Lucy and was cast.
In 2000, Mitchell had a small part in The Amanda Show as a customer in Moody's Point. In 2003, she played Erica Enders in the Disney Channel original movie Right on Track, based on the early career of the 2014 NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series Pro Stock champion and her sister Courtney Enders, who was played by Brie Larson. During a hiatus from filming 7th Heaven in 2005, Mitchell played Laura Hunter in the horror sequel Saw II. In 2006, she recorded her debut, self-titled country album. She co-wrote eight of the songs featured on the album, including "Angel", which is about her friend who was killed in a car accident when the two were teenagers.[3] Mitchell starred in the 2007 TV movie I Know What I Saw, which aired on the Lifetime network. 
In 2010, Mitchell took on the role of school counselor Katelyn O'Malley on the third season of The Secret Life of the American Teenager.[4] In March 2016, she was cast in the Pop Hollywood Darlings with fellow 1990s' child stars Jodie Sweetin and Christine Lakin.[5] The series premiered April 12, 2017.
In April 2024, it was announced that Mitchell would co-host along with her former co-stars, Mackenzie Rosman and David Gallagher, a 7th Heaven rewatch podcast named, Catching up with the Camdens![6]

Personal life[edit]
Mitchell married her long-time boyfriend Michael Cameron on October 1, 2008, in Ravello, Italy on the Amalfi Coast. Former 7th Heaven castmates Jessica Biel and Mackenzie Rosman served as bridesmaids.[7][8] They have a son[9] and two daughters.[10][11]
