The Jenkins were an American country music group comprising Nancy Jenkins and her daughters, Kacie and Brodie. The trio had two singles in the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs charts: "Blame It on Mama" at No. 34 and "Getaway Car" at No. 38. The latter was later a single for Hall & Oates. An album was recorded for Capitol Nashville but never released.


Biography[edit]
Nancy Jenkins and her daughters began to perform together when she started to produce the annual talent show at Kacie and Brodie's school.[1] When Kacie was in sixth grade, the three performed The Judds' song "Guardian Angels" in a school production. Dennis Hysom, a local songwriter, who attended the show persuaded Nancy and her daughters to pursue a career as a country music trio.[1] The three then recorded a demo tape, with Nancy writing some of the songs.[2]
In 2003, the trio was signed to Capitol Records, working with singer-songwriter and record producer Rodney Crowell on the first album, to be called The Jenkins.[2][3] "Blame It on Mama" was released as an advance single in early 2004; the song was a minor top 40 hit in the Billboard U.S. Hot Country Songs chart.[2] A second single, "Getaway Car", was released but the album itself was never released. "Getaway Car" was originally recorded by 4 Runner on their album Getaway Car, and was later a hit in the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts when Hall & Oates recorded it.
The Jenkins left Capitol in 2008.[4]
