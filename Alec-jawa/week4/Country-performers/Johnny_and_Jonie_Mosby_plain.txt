Biography[edit]
John Robert "Johnny" Mosby (born in Fort Smith, Arkansas; April 26, 1929 – February 19, 2018)[1] and Janice Irene "Jonie" Shields (born in Van Nuys, California on August 10, 1940)[2] met in California when she auditioned for his orchestra.[3] They married in 1958.[2] They started recording for Challenge records that same year. In 1959, they made the first recording of "Tijuana Jail".
Signed to Columbia Records, the duo released its debut single, "Don't Call Me from a Honky Tonk", in 1963. It went to number thirteen on the country music charts and was followed by another Top 20 hit, the number twelve "Trouble in My Arms".[2] By 1965, the duo released Mr. and Mrs. Country Music through Columbia, followed by The New Sweethearts of Country on the Starday Records label.[3]
From 1967 to 1972, the Mosbys recorded for Capitol Records, reaching top 20 again with "Just Hold My Hand" and "I'm Leavin' It Up to You" at numbers twelve and eighteen.[3] In the same timespan, the duo recorded several albums for the label. In 1971, Jonie released a solo single, "I've Been There", which peaked at number 72 on the country charts.[2] They filed for divorce in 1973.
