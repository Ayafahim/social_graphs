Redirect to:Great DivideThis page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect:

From an ambiguous term: This is a redirect from an ambiguous page name to a page or list that disambiguates it. These redirects are pointed to by links that should always be disambiguated.  Therefore, this template should never appear on a page that has "(disambiguation)" in its title â€“ in that case use {{R to disambiguation page}} instead.


From a page move: This is a redirect from a page that has been moved (renamed). This page was kept as a redirect to avoid breaking links, both internal and external, that may have been made to the old page name.

When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
