Biography[edit]
Clint Daniels was born August 24, 1974, in Panama City, Florida, but raised in the Panama City suburb of Lynn Haven. Daniels first gained an interest in music as a child, singing with his sister in church.[2] Inspired by bluegrass music, Daniels taught himself to play guitar at age twelve. After graduating high school, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in pursuit of a career in country music. By 1998, he was discovered by an A&R staff member from the Arista Nashville label, and was signed to the label that year.[2]
He charted two singles, "A Fool's Progress" and "When I Grow Up," which respectively reached No. 44 and No. 53 on the country singles charts. Both were to have been included on a self-titled debut album, which was ultimately not released due to Arista's restructuring.[3] Daniels moved to Epic Records in 2003.[4] Although he released a third single, the No. 56 "The Letter (Almost Home)," he never released an album for Epic and has not recorded since.
Daniels has also co-written songs for other country artists, including the Number One hits "Brokenheartsville" by Joe Nichols[5] and "Roll with Me" by Montgomery Gentry[6] (from 2003 and 2008 respectively), as well as Brooks & Dunn's 2008 single "God Must Be Busy". He also co-wrote two songs that were released in late 2010: Clay Walker's "Where Do I Go from You" and Easton Corbin's "I Can't Love You Back". In late 2013, he co-wrote Josh Thompson's "Cold Beer with Your Name on It". In late 2017, he co-wrote Jon Pardi's "She Ain't in It". In early 2019, he co-wrote Eric Church's "Some of It".
