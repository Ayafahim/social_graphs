Redirect to:Jelly roll
From other capitalisation: This is a redirect from a title with another method of capitalisation. It leads to the title in accordance with the Wikipedia naming conventions for capitalisation, or it leads to a title that is associated in some way with the conventional capitalisation of this redirect title.  This may help writing, searching and international language issues.
If this redirect is an incorrect capitalisation, then {{R from miscapitalisation}} should be used instead, and pages that use this link should be updated to link directly to the target.  Miscapitalisations can be tagged in any namespace.
Use this rcat to tag only mainspace redirects; when other capitalisations are in other namespaces, use {{R from modification}} instead.


From an ambiguous term: This is a redirect from an ambiguous page name to a page or list that disambiguates it. These redirects are pointed to by links that should always be disambiguated.  Therefore, this template should never appear on a page that has "(disambiguation)" in its title â€“ in that case use {{R to disambiguation page}} instead.
