Amongst his co-writing credits are the Number Ones "I'm Just Talkin' About Tonight," the Willie Nelson duet "Beer for My Horses," "I Love This Bar," "Whiskey Girl," and "As Good as I Once Was",[6] as well as the Top Five hits "Get Drunk and Be Somebody" and "A Little Too Late." Emerick plays acoustic guitar and sings backing vocals, and as of April 2018, he is credited on 23 Toby Keith releases.[7]
As a musician, Emerick began his songwriting career in the mid-1990s, landing cuts by Sawyer Brown,[6] including their Top 5 single "I Don't Believe in Goodbye", which he co-wrote with Bryan White. Emerick has also released four singles of his own, including the duet "I Can't Take You Anywhere", a collaboration with Toby Keith and a debut album, The Coast Is Clear (2003), for DreamWorks Records Nashville.[3] After the closure of DreamWorks' recording division, he signed to Toby's label, Show Dog Nashville.[2]
