Niko Moon (born Nicholas Cowan; September 20, 1982) is an American country pop singer and songwriter formerly signed to RCA Nashville.[2] He has written songs for Dierks Bentley, Zac Brown Band, Rascal Flatts, and Morgan Wallen.[3] He was also a member of the group Sir Rosevelt with Zac Brown and Ben Simonetti.[4]


Background[edit]
Nicholas Cowan is originally from Tyler, Texas but relocated to Douglasville, Georgia, when he was 10. His father, a truck driver and his mother, a waitress, introduced Niko to the works of artists like John Prine and Patty Griffin.[5] He started out as a drummer after seeing his father play. His father was also a musician and gave up being a touring drummer when Niko was born.[6]

Career[edit]
Niko Moon first found success as a co-writer on songs for the Zac Brown Band, including “Heavy Is the Head”, “Homegrown”, “Beautiful Drug", "Keep Me in Mind", and "Loving You Easy” as well as Keep Me in Mind and Island Song under the credits as Nic Cowan.[7] He also co-produced the Zac Brown Band albums Jekyll+Hyde and Welcome Home, and co-wrote the song “Back To Life” for Rascal Flatts along with Cary Barlowe, Shay Mooney, and Fred Wilhelm.[8] He appeared on Colt Ford’s album Every Chance I Get on the track "Waste Some Time" with Nappy Roots.
In 2010, under the name Nic Cowan, Niko Moon self-released his debut EP titled "Cheap Wine," which featured seven tracks. The following year saw the release of his first full-length album, "Hard Headed," also under the Nic Cowan moniker. According to Moon, the album's title track, "Hard Headed," delves into themes of resisting control from a romantic partner. Distributed by Southern Ground Records, the album includes 13 tracks, among them notable songs such as "Reno," "New Sh*t," and "Cut it Loose (feat. Zac Brown)."[9]
In 2016, Moon formed the group Sir Rosevelt with Zac Brown and Ben Simonetti, another co-writer with the Zac Brown Band. The group's track “The Bravest” was used during the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[10]
Moon and Simonetti co-wrote a song on Michael Franti’s album Stay Human Vol. II.[11]
In 2019, Niko Moon signed a recording contract with Sony Music Nashville imprint RCA Nashville.[12]
