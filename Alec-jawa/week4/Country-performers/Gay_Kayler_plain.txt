Gay Kayler (born 27 September 1941) is an Australian country music entertainer - a vocalist, television personality, recording artist, pianist, triple beauty quest title holder, model, scriptwriter and educator. Gay used her maiden name in her professional career until 1978, when she changed the spelling from Kahler to Kayler to maintain a consistency of pronunciation. She retired in 1998.


Early life[edit]
Gay Kayler comes from a musical family. Her mother sang and played piano, piano accordion and violin with her siblings in their father's dance band on the Darling Downs, Queensland, in the 1930s.[1]
In 1942, the Kayler family moved to Sydney, where Gay continued this musical tradition when, at the age of two-and-a-half, she captivated commuters on Sydney's trams and buses as she sang for them.[2]
In the early 1950s, Gay sang on one of the first reel-to-reel tape recorders in Australia – as part of its demonstration at the Sydney Royal Easter Show.
After attaining her certificate for 7th Grade Piano, Theory and Musical Perception, Gay and her family moved to Toowoomba, Queensland. It was there that Gay made her first professional performance in 1958.

Gay Kayler's reputation blossomed when she was chosen to sing the Alexandra Waltz for Princess Alexandra during her 1959 visit to Australia.[3] The Fairy Princess wanted to hear more so, by royal command, the teenager sang a selection of songs. Ultimately, this led to Gay being contracted to Brisbane's Channel 7 for 3 years, where she appeared in shows such as the multi-Logie-Award-winning Theatre Royal with George Wallace Jnr.[4] Gay Kayler the entertainer
Television and live performances[edit]
Gay's 40-year professional showbusiness career included appearances on most national TV shows, e.g. Brian Henderson's Bandstand, Johnny O'Keefe's Sing, Sing, Sing and Graeme Bell's Trad Jazz.[5] She performed eight times in the main Concert Hall of the Sydney Opera House, including on the first all-Australian Country Music Concert[6] and the first all-Australian Variety Show held in that iconic venue. Gay also featured her Salvation Army Red Shield Appeal Song, Captain Joe Henry's Happy Hand-Clapping, Open Air Rhythm Band, backed by a 300-voice choir and huge Salvation Army band, when she opened and closed a 1976 concert in that venue.[7]
Other notable venues included Melbourne's Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Adelaide's Chrysler Auditorium and the 1,500 strong NSW Registered Club Circuit, said to be the biggest entertainment circuit in the world in its day.

Modelling, commercials and movie sound track[edit]
Gay Kayler, a triple beauty quest title holder, was a singer and model[8] who also made commercials, e.g., with Bert Newton on Australia's Great Barrier Reef[9] and the female voices on the radio commercial, David Callan at Your Club, which was aired over 31,000 times. 
As the 1960 Miss Darling Downs and a Miss Australia Quest State Finalist Australian Country Music Hall of Fame Gay received training on social skills, personal style and etiquette from June Dally-Watkins OAM, one of the 100 Australian Legends, a National Treasure, and Australia’s go-to expert on correct behaviour June Marie Dally-Watkins 1927-2020. This included deportment and posture, how to sit elegantly, how to set a table and dining etiquette.

Gay recorded the female sound track on the 1978 Little Boy Lost movie,[10] which was released worldwide.Nick Erby, Johnny Ashcroft, Steven Walls, Gay Kayler at movie premiere Terry Bourke, the movie's director, presented an autographed copy of Little Boy Lost, a book based on his screenplay, to Gay Kayler at the movie premiere.Autograph inside the Little Boy Lost book presented to Gay Kayler at the Little Boy Lost movie world premiere.

She was also the inaugural president of the Toowoomba Bachelor Girls Service Club.[19]

Recordings[edit]
Gay Kayler's recording career began in 1973 when she recorded the EMI album, Faces of Love, with Johnny Ashcroft. She had a double charting single in 1975 of "Nobody's Child"[20] coupled with the first Australian female trucking song, "My Home-Coming Trucker's Coming Home", composed by Ashcroft. She was chosen to record Ruth Cotton's Dream Away My Life, an RCA/2KY Country Songwriter prize-winner. Her last recording in 1995 was "Child of Koonapippi", a song of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, written by Eric Watson (re-released 2001).[21] Gay Kayler in a country music production

Gay is best known for her version of The White Magnolia Tree, which was in EMI and Reader's Digest catalogues for over 33 years; also for her work on the heritage LP, The Cross of the Five Silver Stars – in particular for Matthew, a song of the great navigator, Matthew Flinders. This album was a finalist for the Heritage Award in the Australasian Country Music Awards. It was re-released as part of the 2007 Rajon Music Australian historical double CD set, Johnny Ashcroft, Here's To You, Australia![22] It also features Bettybo and musical director, Shep Davis.
