She has recorded four studio albums, and has charted three singles on the Hot Country Songs charts. Her highest single is the 1990s "Tell Me Why" at No. 18.  She was named "Female Entertainer of the Year", and her song "Louisville" was named "Song of the Year", by the California Country Music Association.[3] In 1990, she was nominated for Top New Female Vocalist at the Academy of Country Music Awards, along with Daniele Alexander and Mary Chapin Carpenter, but lost to Carpenter.
