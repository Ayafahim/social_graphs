Daniel Jay Gokey (born April 24, 1980) is an American singer and former church music director. He was the third-place finalist on the eighth season of American Idol.[1][2] After his placing on the show, Gokey signed to 19 Recordings and RCA Nashville at the beginning of a career in country music, releasing the single "My Best Days Are Ahead of Me." His debut album, My Best Days, was released in March 2010.
After leaving RCA Nashville in November 2011, he gravitated his music towards an adult pop/contemporary Christian sound and subsequently made a record deal with BMG Rights Management in May 2013. He released his second studio album, Hope in Front of Me, in 2014.


Early life[edit]
Gokey started singing with his family in church, but stated he would rather record mainstream music than perform solely Christian/gospel music. He was the worship director at his church in Milwaukee, Faith Builders International Ministries, for several years.[3][4]
He is the fifth of six children. He has a brother named Charles, and four sisters: Angela, Janell, Gina, and Tracey.[5][6]
He has acknowledged the influence of Jeffrey and Robin Pruitt, who are the pastors of the church where he worked, and also Matthew Barnett, the founder of the LA Dream Center.  He has stated that his faith is the "key to who I am".[7] Gokey was a church music director, while also driving a semi truck for a local logistics company for two years.[4]

American Idol[edit]

Overview[edit]
Gokey rose to national fame with his participation in the eighth season of American Idol. Gokey's American Idol audition occurred only four weeks after his wife's death in July 2008.[8] He auditioned with his friend Jamar Rogers, who also made it through to Hollywood but was eliminated before the live shows.
During Rock Week (Top 4 week), Gokey's take on Aerosmith's "Dream On" was planned for the extended scream with which he finished the song.[9] Gokey was the only contestant in that season who was never in the bottom two or three, but he was eliminated in third place on May 13, 2009, after his performance of Joe Cocker's "You Are So Beautiful".[10]
During the season 8 finale on May 20, 2009, Gokey performed a duet with rhythm and blues singer-songwriter Lionel Richie. The performance opened with Gokey singing a true-to-the-original soulful ballad solo of Richie's "Hello," and then Richie joined Gokey for a duet of his hits "Just Go" and "All Night Long".[11]

On July 9, 2008, four weeks before he auditioned for American Idol, Gokey's wife died from complications during her third surgery to treat her congenital heart disease.[79][80][81] The couple had been together for 12 years, and Gokey credited her for his success.[82] Sophia was a fan of American Idol and encouraged Gokey to be a contestant, and Danny started a foundation in her name, Sophia's Heart Foundation, with some of her family members who are also musicians.[80][83][84] With branches in Milwaukee, Nashville, and Sacramento, the organization's goals are to provide hope and help to homeless families, provide scholarships to deserving students and operate a thriving inner-city music and arts program.[84]
