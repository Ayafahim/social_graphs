Joseph Sloan Bonsall Jr. (May 18, 1948 – July 9, 2024) was an American singer who was the tenor vocalist of the country and gospel vocal quartet the Oak Ridge Boys from 1973 to 2023.[1] Besides charting numerous hits as a member of the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall had a solo chart credit alongside the band Sawyer Brown in their 1986 single "Out Goin' Cattin'", on which he was credited as "Cat Joe Bonsall".


Biography[edit]
Bonsall was born on May 18, 1948 in Philadelphia, to Joseph Sloan Bonsall Sr., and Lillie Maude Collins, who both served in World War II.[2][3] He also had a sister, Nancy Marie.
Bonsall performed in gospel groups of the Northeastern United States before joining the Oak Ridge Boys in 1973.[2] As an author, Bonsall released a four-part children's book series in 1997 titled The Molly Books[4] and in 2003 published GI Joe and Lillie,[5] a book about his parents' lives during and after World War II.  He also authored On The Road With The Oak Ridge Boys, An American Journey, From My Perspective, and An Inconvenient Christmas.  His latest book, I See Myself, a memoir, is slated to be released posthumously in November 2024.[6]
Bonsall was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2015 as a member of the Oak Ridge Boys.[3]

Illness and death[edit]
Bonsall missed several tour dates in 2022 and was hospitalized for what at the time was stated to be pulmonary embolisms;[7] by 2023, Bonsall developed what he described as "a bad leg. It doesn't hurt, it's just—bad."[8] For the group's farewell tour, Bonsall sang sitting on a stool and had to be assisted on and off the stage by fellow band member Duane Allen.[8] On January 3, 2024, Bonsall released a statement announcing his retirement from touring with the Oak Ridge Boys due to a "slow-onset neuromuscular disease" (posthumously revealed as being amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS) that was diagnosed in 2019. For the rest of the tour, Ben James sang in Bonsall's stead.[9]
Bonsall died due to complications of ALS in Hendersonville, Tennessee, on July 9, 2024, at the age of 76.[6][10][11]
