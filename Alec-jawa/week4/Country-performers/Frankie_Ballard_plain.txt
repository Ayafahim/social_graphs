In the summer of 2008 he signed up for Kenny Chesney's Next Big Star competition.[6]  After winning the competition for Michigan in 2008,[7] Ballard also opened shows for Chesney at Michigan venues.
He signed to Reprise Records Nashville in 2010 and released his debut single "Tell Me You Get Lonely."[8] It received a four-star review from Kyle Ward of Roughstock, who praised Ballard's voice and called the song "an above average debut effort."[9] The song debuted at Number 59 on the Hot Country Songs charts dated for the week ending June 12, 2010,[10] and peaked at number 33 in early 2011.
On January 7, 2011, Ballard made his debut appearance at the Grand Ole Opry.

Also in 2011, he opened for Lady Antebellum.
In 2013, Ballard moved to Warner Bros. Records and released his third single, "Helluva Life". This is the lead single to his second album, Sunshine & Whiskey. It became his first number 1 single in early 2014.[12] Later in the year, the album's title track went to number 1. "Young & Crazy", the album's third single, also went to number 1.
