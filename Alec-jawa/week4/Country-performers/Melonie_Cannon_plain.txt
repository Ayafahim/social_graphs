Biography[edit]
Early years[edit]
Cannon was born in Jackson, Tennessee, but her family moved to Nashville when she was three years old. She is the daughter of country music songwriter and producer Buddy Cannon,[2] and the sister of songwriter Marla Cannon-Goodman.[3]
At age 14, she began singing background vocals for artists such as John Michael Montgomery, George Jones, and Kenny Chesney. At age 16, she recorded a duet of "Cry Cry Darlin'" with Sammy Kershaw.[4]
After a stint in the Army, she returned to Nashville to sing demos and help her father with his publishing and production companies.[5][6] Ronnie Bowman heard her sing at Nashville's Station Inn, and helped her assemble a group of musicians to record with.[7]

In 2008, Cannon released And the Wheels Turn on Rural Rhythm. Cannon and Willie Nelson sang a duet on "Back To Earth."[8] Dan Tyminski, Ronnie Bowman, and Sonya Isaacs provide vocals. The album was co-produced by Buddy Cannon and Bowman.
