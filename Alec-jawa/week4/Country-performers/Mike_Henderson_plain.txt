Michael James Henderson (July 14, 1953 – September 22, 2023)[1][2] was an American singer-songwriter. In addition to his solo career, which included five studio albums, Henderson was a member of the country band The SteelDrivers from 2005 to 2011 and was a songwriting collaborator of his former SteelDrivers bandmate Chris Stapleton.


Biography[edit]
Early life and career[edit]
Henderson was born in Independence, Missouri, in 1953.[3][4] He was an original member of blues group the Bel Airs when they formed in Missouri in 1981.[5][6] They released an album, Need Me a Car, on Blind Pig Records in 1984.[5][7] Henderson left the band in 1985 and moved to Nashville.[5][8] The following year, he joined the roots rock band The Roosters.[8] He was also a member of spin-off band The Kingsnakes.[8] The Kingsnakes began playing weekly at the Bluebird Cafe in July 1986.[9] They shortened their name to The Snakes when they were signed by Curb Records.[9] An album, The Snakes, was released by Curb in 1989.[10]
In 1988, The Fabulous Thunderbirds covered "Powerful Stuff", a song Henderson had written for The Snakes, for the soundtrack to the film Cocktail.[8][11] Henderson later became a staff songwriter for EMI.[7] His songs have been recorded by the Dixie Chicks, Trisha Yearwood, Gary Allan and Patty Loveless, among others.[12][13] Henderson also found work in Nashville as a slide guitarist.[14] He played on albums by Emmylou Harris, John Hiatt, Joy Lynn White and Kelly Willis.[8][13]

Country Music Made Me Do It[edit]
Henderson's demos drew the attention of country music label RCA Nashville.[7] RCA signed Henderson and released his solo debut album, Country Music Made Me Do It, in March 1994.[15] Bob Cannon of Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A− grade, writing that Henderson's "enthusiastic field holler and his guitar's riveting twang give off enough sparks to ignite [the songs]."[16] Dan Kening of the Chicago Tribune gave the album three and a half stars, saying that "Henderson downplays his guitar chops on his first solo album in favor of his songwriting and strong vocals and acquits himself admirably."[17] The album also received a favorable review from Peter Cronin of Billboard, who declared that "Henderson comes to the party with plenty of attitude and a distinctive point of view."[18]
The album's first single, "Hillbilly Jitters", peaked at number 69 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.[4] When subsequent singles "The Want To" and "If the Jukebox Took Teardrops" failed to chart, Henderson was dropped by the label.[19] "If the Jukebox Took Teardrops" was later a minor chart hit for Danni Leigh in 1998.[20]

Edge of Night[edit]
After being dropped by RCA, Henderson founded the label Dead Reckoning Records with Kieran Kane, Kevin Welch, Tammy Rogers and Harry Stinson.[19] His second album, Edge of Night, was released by Dead Reckoning in January 1996.[7][21] The video for the first single, a cover of Eddy Clearwater's "I Wouldn't Lay My Guitar Down", was added by CMT in February 1996.[22] Tony Scherman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ grade, writing that Henderson is "a good songwriter, even if he wears his influences a little too plainly."[23] Parry Gettelman of the Orlando Sentinel gave the album five stars, stating that Henderson's "strong, slightly sandpapery voice is as soulful as it is twangy."[24] Chet Flippo of Billboard also reviewed the album favorably, saying that "Henderson manages to sound at once world-weary and exuberant in a solid lineup of original material and country chestnuts."[25]

First Blood[edit]
Later in 1996, Henderson formed the blues band Mike Henderson & the Bluebloods with Reese Wynans on piano, Glenn Worf on bass and John Gardner on drums.[7][14] They released the album First Blood in October 1996 on Dead Reckoning.[26][27] Mark Knopfler wrote the album's liner notes.[28] Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A grade, writing that "First Blood's blistering, seamless blues covers prove [Henderson]'s a remarkable guitarist and frontman."[29] A review in People stated that "when the combination of piano, bass, drums and electric guitar is as neck-snappingly strong as it is on the Bluebloods' first album, you don't need other instruments, original compositions or even many original ideas to deliver a knockout blow."[30] Linda Ray of No Depression also gave the album a positive review, praising Henderson's "masterful guitar and vocals" and saying that "the way he plays that slide is likely illegal in several states."[28] The song "Pay Bo Diddley" received some radio airplay.[14]

Thicker Than Water[edit]
Mike Henderson & the Bluebloods released their second album, Thicker Than Water, in January 1999 with John Barlow Jarvis replacing Reese Wynans on piano.[31] Becky Byrkit of AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five, writing that "Henderson contributes a particularly clear vocal style with plenty of simultaneous character from both the blues and true-blue country music."[31] The album received a mixed review in People, which praised Jarvis' "richly layered, hard-driving solos" but compared Henderson's vocals to "the white-guy-trying-to-sound-soulful desperation of Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi in their Blues Brothers mode."[32] Ed Kopp of All About Jazz gave the album a positive review, saying that "leader Mike Henderson is a highly capable slide guitarist, harpist, and singer, but the guy who makes this CD extra special is John Jarvis."[33] Tim Steil of the Chicago Tribune also gave the album a favorable review, stating that "whether playing Hound Dog Taylor-ish slide, or blowing harp lines that would make Little Walter smile, Henderson deftly conjures the sound of '50s Chicago."[34]

Later career[edit]
Henderson toured with Mark Knopfler on his 2001 Sailing to Philadelphia Tour.[8][12] In 2008, Henderson was one of the founding members of bluegrass group The SteelDrivers.[35] He played mandolin, resophonic guitar and harmonica and co-wrote most of the band's original songs.[36] The SteelDrivers' 2010 album Reckless was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2011.[37] Henderson left The SteelDrivers in December 2011.[38]
Adele performed Henderson's song "If It Hadn't Been for Love" for her 2011 DVD Live at the Royal Albert Hall.[12]
Henderson continued to play weekly shows at the Bluebird Cafe with the Mike Henderson Band.[9][12]

Death[edit]
Mike Henderson died unexpectedly in his sleep on September 22, 2023, at the age of 70.[1][2][39]
