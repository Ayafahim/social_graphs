Joanie Keller (born in Wayne, Nebraska[1]) is an American country music singer. Keller began performing in her father's band when she was a small child.[2] After graduating high school, she played local clubs in Colorado before moving to Nashville to pursue a career as a country singer.[2]
Keller's debut album, Sparks Are Gonna Fly, was released by Broken Bow Records in April 2000.[2] Its first single, "Three Little Teardrops", peaked at number 66 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.[1] The album received a mixed review from Joel Bernstein of Country Standard Time, who wrote that "it's too smooth and polished to grab the hard-core honkytonkers, but it's often too country for much of today's younger audience."[3] Carrie Attebury of about.com compared Keller favorably to Linda Davis.[4]
Since parting ways with Broken Bow, Keller has continued to perform in Nashville with the band 45 RPM.[5] She was inducted into the Nebraska Music Hall of Fame in 2009.[5]
