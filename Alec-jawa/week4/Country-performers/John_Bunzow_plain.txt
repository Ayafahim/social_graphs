John Bunzow (born May 2, 1951[1]) is an American country music singer-songwriter. Bunzow was signed to Liberty Records and charted one single on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.


Career[edit]
Bunzow was signed to Liberty Records (which was then the name of the Nashville subsidiary of Capitol Records) and released his debut single, "Easy as One, Two, Three", in 1995.[2] Deborah Evans Price of Billboard gave the song a favorable review, writing that "Bunzow plays it simple, but keeps things interesting by throwing in some nifty chord-change curves."[3] It peaked at number 69 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.[1] Liberty planned to release Bunzow's album, Stories of the Years, on May 23, 1995.[4] Pemberton Roach of AllMusic gave the album three stars out of five, calling it "a refreshingly direct, no-nonsense country record that had more in common with Steve Earle's best work than with any dance-club pretty boys."[5] Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A grade, writing that Bunzow blends "an amiable tenor with economy of language and the minimalistic production of Dwight Yoakam collaborator Pete Anderson."[6] After Jimmy Bowen left Liberty Records in March 1995 and the label returned to its Capitol Nashville name, the album was shelved and Bunzow was dropped.[7][8]
Bunzow continued writing and performing.[7] A compilation of material Bunzow wrote for publishing companies in Nashville, Off the Shelf, was released by ZoDog Records in 2000.[9] In 2002, Bunzow recorded an album, Darkness and Light, which was released by independent label Sideburn Records.[7] Bob Gottlieb of AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five, calling it "a strong disc that rips into each new song with a strong ferocity that brings the song home."[10] Bunzow also released a live album, Alive at O'Connor's, in 2004.[9]
