Forrest Richard Betts (December 12, 1943 – April 18, 2024) was an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, composer and founding member of the Allman Brothers Band. He initially shared the band's signature dual lead guitar roles with band founder Duane Allman, and assumed the solo lead after Allman's death in October of 1971.  As both a singer and composer as well, he was central to the group's greatest commercial success in the mid-1970s and was the writer and vocalist on the Allmans' hit single "Ramblin' Man". 
Early in his career Betts was best noted for collaboration with Duane Allman,[1] the twosome introducing melodic twin guitar harmony and counterpoint, which, according to Guitar World "rewrote the rules for how two rock guitarists can work together, completely scrapping the traditional rhythm/lead roles to stand toe to toe".[2] Betts initially gained renown for his epic instrumental, "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed", from the Band's second album, Idlewild South, followed by his striking guitar duet-driven "Blue Sky", which not only was his first band vocal but signaled a dramatic new sound and potential direction for it.  
In the wake of Duane's death the group indeed followed both Betts' musical direction and band leadership, exploding into commercial success in 1974 upon the introduction of the Country-influenced Brothers and Sisters, and the chart success of its catchy Betts-written hits, exuberant "Ramblin' Man" and the melodic instrumental "Jessica".
The band went through a hiatus in the late 1970s, during which time Betts, like many of the other band members, pursued a solo career and side projects under such names as Great Southern and The Dickey Betts Band.  The Allman Brothers reformed in 1979, with Dan Toler taking the second guitar role alongside Betts.  In 1982, it broke up a second time, during which break Betts formed the group Betts, Hall, Leavell and Trucks, which lasted until 1984.  A third reformation occurred in 1989, with Warren Haynes then joining Betts on guitar. 
Betts was ousted from the band in 2000 over a conflict regarding his continued drug and alcohol abuse; he never played with them again, nor would he appear with other former band members for reunions or side projects. With the death of Betts on April 18, 2024, Jai Johanny "Jaimoe" Johanson is the last living founding member of the Allman Brothers Band.
He was inducted with the band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995[3] and also won a best rock performance Grammy Award with the band for "Jessica" in 1996.[4] Betts was ranked No. 58 on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time list in 2003, and No. 61 on the list published in 2011.[5][6]


Early life[edit]
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (September 2024)
Betts was born in West Palm Beach, Florida, on December 12, 1943, and raised in Bradenton.[7][8] He grew up in a musical family listening to traditional bluegrass, country music and Western swing. He started playing ukulele at the age of five and, as his hands got bigger, moved on to mandolin, banjo, and guitar.

Career[edit]
By the age of sixteen Betts was feeling the need for something "a little faster", and played in a series of rock bands on the Florida circuit, up the East Coast and into the Midwest.  In 1967 he formed the Second Coming in Florida with Berry Oakley. According to its composer, Rick Derringer, the group called the Jokers referenced in "Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo" was one of Betts' early groups of that name.[9]

Early Allman Brothers Band years[edit]
In 1969, Duane Allman, a veteran of the South's "Chitlin' Circuit" of roadhouses and small local venues who'd gone on to form several bands with recording contracts, was casting for talent to build another around.  A successful session player, he'd gained a deal with Southern soul impresario Phil Walden, who planned to back a power trio featuring Allman. The ensuing Allman Brothers Band eventually grew to six members, including Duane's brother, organist, vocalist, and composer Gregg, Betts, and bassist Berry Oakley.[citation needed] Duane, who later worked with famed British guitar virtuoso Eric Clapton, earning notoriety for his standout playing on "Layla, the collaboration's signature hit, once said with typical modesty, "I'm the famous guitar player, but Dickey is the good one."[10] 
After Allman's death in October 1971, Betts became the band's sole lead guitarist (with a pianist bringing the group back up to six members) and took on a greater singing, composing, and leadership role. Rushed into the role, he practiced slide guitar intensively in order to be able to cover the majority of Duane's parts. He wrote "Jessica", inspired by his young daughter Jessica,[11]and the Allmans' biggest commercial hit, "Ramblin' Man",[12] for the Band's breakout commercial success, Brothers and Sisters, in 1974.

Solo career and later work[edit]
Betts in 1974
Betts's first solo album, Highway Call, was released in 1974 and featured fiddle player Vassar Clements.[13] After the Allman Brothers fell apart in 1976, Betts released more albums, starting with Dickey Betts & Great Southern in 1977, which included the song "Bougainvillea", co-written with future Hollywood star and then Florida transplant Don Johnson.[14] In 1978 he released an album, Atlanta's Burning Down.[15]
The Allman Brothers reformed in 1979 for the album Enlightened Rogues, with two members of Great Southern replacing Allman Brothers members who were unwilling to participate in the reunion: guitar player Dan Toler for pianist Chuck Leavell, and bassist David Goldflies for bassist Lamar Williams. Several albums and personnel changes followed, until declining record and concert ticket sales, personnel issues, and management problems led the group to disband again in 1982.[16]
Betts formed his own band, Betts, Hall, Leavell and Trucks, where he was co-frontman along with former Wet Willie singer, saxophone, and harmonica player Jimmy Hall. Despite earning good notices, the group was unable to secure a recording contract and disbanded in 1984.[17] Betts  returned to his solo career performing live at smaller venues, and released the album Pattern Disruptive in 1989. When a one-off reunion tour was proposed in support of the Allman Brothers' Dreams box set, released in 1989 to commemorate the band's 20th anniversary, Betts's solo band again supplied the Allman Brothers' other lead guitarist, Warren Haynes. The success of the one-off tour resulted in a permanent reunion, which absorbed Betts's energies for the remainder of the 1990s. This band line-up released three studio albums between 1990 and 1994 and won the praise of the critics.[18]

Betts in 2008
Betts was replaced on numerous Allman Brothers tour dates throughout the mid-to-late 1990s, for what were reported in the media as "personal reasons". While remaining active as a touring band, the Allman Brothers did not release another album of studio material after 1994's Where It All Begins for nine years, until Hittin' the Note in 2003. In 1994, Haynes and Allmans bassist Allen Woody formed Gov't Mule with former Dickey Betts Band drummer Matt Abts as a side project, and left the Allman Brothers for Gov't Mule full-time in 1997. Betts' last show with the Allman Brothers was at the Music Midtown Festival in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 7, 2000.[19]
A breaking point was reached after that show and before the launch of the band's Summer Campaign Tour when the remaining original Allman Brothers members – Gregg Allman, Butch Trucks, and Jaimoe – suspended Betts.[20] According to Betts, the band told him (reportedly via fax) to "get clean" (from alcohol and/or drugs). 
He was temporarily replaced for the 2000 tour by Jimmy Herring, formerly of the Aquarium Rescue Unit. When Betts filed suit against the other three original Allmans, the separation turned into a permanent divorce.[21] Betts re-formed the Dickey Betts Band and toured that same summer. The band reassumed the name Dickey Betts & Great Southern and added Betts' son Duane (named after Duane Allman) on lead guitar. In 2005, Betts released the DVD Live from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[22]
Although they had been separated personally and as musical bandmates for over 15 years, Betts and Gregg Allman became reconciled before Allman's death in 2017.[23]
Betts' final album release was Dickey Betts & Great Southern Official Bootleg Vol. 1 (2021), a two-CD live album of performances from the 2000s.[24]

Personal life[edit]
Betts was married five times, last to Donna, in 1989.[25] He had four children: Kimberly, Christy, Jessica, and Duane. Christy is married to Frank Hannon of the band Tesla. Jessica is the namesake of Betts' instrumental. Duane, named for Betts' former bandmate Duane Allman, is also a musician and performed and recorded with his father, and in a band together with Gregg Allman's son Devon.[26]
Betts was a Florida native, born in West Palm Beach; though he resided briefly in Georgia during the formative years of the Allman Brothers Band, he lived in the Sarasota metropolitan area for most of his life.[27]

Death[edit]
In August 2018, the 74-year old Betts suffered a mild stroke and had to cancel tour dates with his Dickey Betts Band. He was taken to the hospital and was in a critical but stable condition at a Florida hospital, following an accident at his home in Osprey, Florida. On September 20, 2018,[28] he successfully underwent surgery to relieve swelling on his brain. In a statement posted on his website, Betts and his family said the "outpouring of support from all over the world has been overwhelming and amazing. We are so appreciative."[29]
Betts died from cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at his home in Osprey, Florida, on April 18, 2024, at the age of 80.[30][31]
