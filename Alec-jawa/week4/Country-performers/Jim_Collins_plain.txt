Redirect to:James CollinsThis page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect:

From a merge: This is a redirect from a page that was merged into another page. This redirect was kept in order to preserve the edit history of this page after its content was merged into the content of the target page.  Please do not remove the tag that generates this text (unless the need to recreate content on this page has been demonstrated) or delete this page.
For redirects with substantive page histories that did not result from page merges use {{R with history}} instead.


From an ambiguous term: This is a redirect from an ambiguous page name to a page or list that disambiguates it. These redirects are pointed to by links that should always be disambiguated.  Therefore, this template should never appear on a page that has "(disambiguation)" in its title â€“ in that case use {{R to disambiguation page}} instead.

When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
