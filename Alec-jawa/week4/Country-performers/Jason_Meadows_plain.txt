Jason Meadows (born June 9, 1971) is a country music artist signed to Baccerstick Records. He was raised in Calera, Oklahoma. Meadows was a second-place finalist on the third season of the USA Networks talent show Nashville Star.[1] Three singles were released from his debut album 100% Cowboy (the title track, "18 Video Tapes" and "Where Did My Dirt Road Go"), but all failed to chart.[2] The album reached No. 59 on Top Country Albums. "18 Video Tapes" received a "thumbs up" rating from Engine 145, a country music review site. Reviewer Matt C. said, "Here’s a Nashville Star alumnus who didn’t score a major-label deal but nonetheless is producing interesting and compelling music."[3]
