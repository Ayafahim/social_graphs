Redirect to:Black HawkThis page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect:

From an alternative spelling: This is a redirect from a title with an alternative spelling of the target name. Pages that link to this redirect may be updated to link directly to the target page if that results in an improvement of the text.  Do not "fix" such links if they are not broken.  Also, these links should not be replaced with piped links.
There are many more specific templates such as {{R from alternative hyphenation}}, {{R from alternative punctuation}} and {{R from alternative spacing}}. Also see subcategories of Category:Redirects from modifications for other options (capitals, abbreviations, diacritics, plurals, stylizations, transliteration, ligatures, different parts of speech, etc.)


From an ambiguous term: This is a redirect from an ambiguous page name to a page or list that disambiguates it. These redirects are pointed to by links that should always be disambiguated.  Therefore, this template should never appear on a page that has "(disambiguation)" in its title â€“ in that case use {{R to disambiguation page}} instead.

When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
