She became an official member of the Zac Brown Band in 2022.[3]


Early life and education[edit]
Caroline Jones was born in New York City to Sonia and Paul Tudor Jones, and raised in Greenwich, Connecticut.[4][5] She attended the Professional Children's School in New York City and later New York University where she studied creative writing.[5][1] She took singing lessons when she was nine, and wrote her first song when she was ten.[6] She learned to sing opera and jazz under Andy Anselmo, and she also learned how to play various instruments including piano, guitar, banjo, mandolin, harmonica, and Dobro.[7] She was for some time more interested in pop, rock and R&B music until she visited Nashville when she was 16 or 17, and switched her interest to country music.[5][8]

Career[edit]
In 2010, Jones launched The Heart is Smart initiative, which included performing in schools and colleges and providing music workshop for students.[4] She also wrote and produced her debut album herself in New York City and Nashville in 2010, playing multiple instruments on the album. In January 2011, Jones self-released the album, Fallen Flower.[9][10] She quickly followed with three albums the following year.[6][11]
In 2013, Jones became the host of Art & Soul, a radio show on SiriusXM's Coffee House interviewing musicians on their music and songwriting.[8]
In 2017, she opened for Zac Brown Band and in 2018 Jimmy Buffett.[7] Through Buffett, she became signed to his Mailboat Records, and she also collaborated with Buffett on a song.[12]
Jones was listed as one of the 10 need-to-know new country artists by Rolling Stone in 2017,[13] and one of 15 country artists to watch by Billboard in 2018.[14]
Jones released Bare Feet in March 2018. Jones wrote all the songs in the album, which was produced by Ric Wake.[15] In 2019, she was listed among the 40 Under 40 List put out by Connecticut Magazine.[16]
Jones' single, "Chasin' Me", entered the Mediabase country chart at number 50 for the week ending June 1, 2019.[17]
In 2021, she release the album Antipodes.[18]
In 2022, she joined Zac Brown Band as a member of the band. She had previously opened for the band on a number of tours since 2017, as well as appearing as a guest performer in other tours.[3]

Personal life[edit]
In late 2021, Jones married professional sailor Nick Dana.  Their son, Declan Tudor Dana, was born on November 29, 2023.
