The Peasall Sisters are a country harmony group formed by three of the six Peasall siblings. They are best known for their singing in the 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou?.


Biography[edit]
The six Peasall siblings were born and raised in White House, Tennessee. Group members include Sarah (alto voice, guitar), Hannah (soprano voice, mandolin), and Leah (mezzo-soprano voice, violin).

Film participation[edit]
In the 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou?, they provided the singing voices for Ulysses Everett McGill's (George Clooney) daughters, the Wharvey Girls. They sang "In the Highways" and "Angel Band".[1]
The Peasall Sisters – Family Harmony DVD was released in 2006, and shows the sisters with their family and singing.[2]
For the soundtrack of the 2010 film True Grit, the sisters contribute their version of Mosie Lister's gospel song "Where No One Stands Alone".[3]

Appearances[edit]
As part of the Down from the Mountain tour, the sisters performed at the Radio City Music Hall and Carnegie Hall. They have also appeared at the Grand Ole Opry.[4]

Awards[edit]
Their inclusion on the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack album made the group the youngest vocal group nominated for a contribution to a winner of the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.[5] Their win in the category made Leah Peasall the youngest Grammy winner in history at 8 years old.[6]

Recordings[edit]
The sisters have released two albums: in 2002, First Offering[4] and in 2005 Home to You, on which they are accompanied by artists such as Randy Scruggs, Larry Perkins, Jamie Hartford, and Leroy Troy.[7]
