The Ranch is an American sitcom television series created by Don Reo and Jim Patterson. It starred Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson (who previously co-starred on That '70s Show) as brothers Colt and Rooster Bennett, respectively; who help run the Colorado cattle ranch owned by their father Beau (Sam Elliott). It also starred Debra Winger as their mother Maggie, a local bar owner, and Elisha Cuthbert as Colt's love interest Abby, a local schoolteacher. Other cast members from That 70s Show who had recurring roles included Wilmer Valderrama, Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp. It debuted in 2016 on Netflix and ran for four seasons in eight parts.[2]
Each season consists of 20 episodes broken up into two parts, each containing 10 episodes, which are approximately 30 minutes in length. All episodes are named after American country music songs.[3]


Premise[edit]
The show takes place on Iron River Ranch, near the fictitious small town of Garrison, Colorado (population 512, as displayed on a sign in the opening credits). Dialogue places the town in southwestern Colorado (near the real town of Ouray, Colorado), about a six hour drive from Denver. The series details the life of the Bennetts, a dysfunctional family consisting of brothers Colt and Rooster, their father Beau, and their mother Maggie who owns the local bar.[4]

Cast[edit]
Main[edit]
Ashton Kutcher as Colt Reagan Bennett, a former star quarterback for his high school football team who returns to his hometown after a fifteen-year absence to help his father and older brother on their family ranch while waiting for a tryout with a new semi-pro team in Denver. In the first episode, Colt reveals that he was the third-string quarterback for the Florida State team that won the National Championship in 1999. He pursued a professional career with little success, never finding regular playing time or stardom even on semi-pro teams, but hanging on in backup roles and on practice squads. Colt is frequently the butt of jokes, particularly when it comes to his lack of ranching skills, sub-par intelligence, and unsuccessful pro football career. He is a heavy drinker and has a habit of not using common sense, often acting before he thinks, but he is friendly and cares about other people deep down. Based on his various T-shirts and dialogue, it's implied Colt has played for the Barcelona Dragons, San Jose SaberCats, Spokane Shock, Orlando Predators, Nebraska Danger, Sioux City Bandits, Iowa Barnstormers, Green Bay Blizzard, Minnesota Axemen, Portland Forest Dragons and Philadelphia Soul. Dialogue and team gear also indicate that he was a member of teams in Canada, notably the Ottawa Redblacks and fictional Saskatoon Cold ("Like the Miami Heat... only cold"). He has also played on teams in Alaska and was a member of the Buffalo Bills practice squad. He later marries Abby, his high school sweetheart, and they become the parents of a daughter they name Peyton.
Danny Masterson as Jameson "Rooster" Ford Bennett (seasons 1–3), Colt's older brother. He has lived and worked on the ranch since Colt left to follow his football career, at times showing a bitter attitude for accepting the responsibility while Colt pursued his dream. Despite living in Colt's shadow, he is far more competent on the ranch and a more rational thinker. He has, however, been just as immature as Colt, drinking too much and slacking off. In the first half of part 5, Rooster gets into a rivalry with his ex-girlfriend Mary's intimidating boyfriend Nick, and in the second episode of Part 6, it is discovered that Rooster's motorcycle went off the side of a dangerous road; he is missing and presumed dead.
Debra Winger as Maggie Bennett, owner of Maggie's bar, and Colt and Rooster's mother. Maggie is at first separated and later divorced from Beau and lives in a trailer behind the bar she owns. Maggie is a free-thinker, an environmentalist, and an avid marijuana smoker. Much more patient and laid-back than Beau, Colt and Rooster often seek her company and advice on how to deal with problems, especially those concerning Beau.
Sam Elliott as Beau Roosevelt Bennett, Maggie's ex-husband, and Colt and Rooster's father. A Vietnam War veteran, he has worked the ranch since returning from the war and taking it over after his father died. He is a curmudgeon, constantly annoyed with everyone and everything. He has a strained relationship with Rooster and Colt. He hates modern amenities and is easily angered by Colt and Rooster's antics. Beau appears to be a Republican with a soft-spot for Ronald Reagan but at times seems to despise all politicians regardless of affiliation.
Elisha Cuthbert as Abby Phillips-Bennett (seasons 2–4; recurring, season 1), a Garrison High School history teacher and Colt's high school sweetheart. As the series begins, Abby has been in a five-year relationship with Kenny Ballard and briefly becomes engaged to him. As the series progresses, she breaks off her engagement to Kenny to reconnect with Colt, ultimately marrying Colt and having a baby girl, Peyton, with him.

Reception[edit]
Critical response[edit]
The Ranch has earned mixed to positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the series an average approval rating of 63% (60% for season 1, 67% for season 2) based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "A formulaic set-up and predictable plotting are elevated by The Ranch's surprising sensitivity and strong performances."[17] Metacritic gave the series a score of 56 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[18]
Writing for Slate in a positive review, television critic Willa Paskin wrote of the show, "The Ranch is a red-state sitcom, though it takes place in the swing state of Colorado, and is good enough to be watched by people of any political affiliation" and "The goodness sneaks up on you."[19] Los Angeles Times wrote: "[Elliott and Winger's] scenes together, as restrained as they are, are the show's most emotionally resonant. You will want to check them out."[20]
