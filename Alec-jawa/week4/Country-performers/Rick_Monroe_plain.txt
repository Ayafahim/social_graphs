Rick Monroe is an American country singer based in Nashville, Tennessee. 


Life and career[edit]
Rick Monroe was born in Clearwater, Florida. He grew up in California, Connecticut, Kansas, North Carolina, and England.[1] He started playing the drums at age nine but then switched to singing.[2]
Monroe started working the coffeehouse circuits, but then formed his own band and developed a touring schedule of over 100 dates a year.[3] In 1996, Monroe established his own record label, Divorce Records, under which he would later release all his four albums.[3] In 1999, when he was based in Los Angeles, Monroe recorded his album Shame at CAM studios in Bulverde, Texas.[4]
Calling him a "musician's musician", Billboard commented that his "warm, supple" voice brought "an edgy energy" to the song.[5] In 2007, Monroe moved to Nashville.[2] His "Crazy Not To" single, released in the summer of 2012, reached top-40 radio and chart status.[6]
It’s A Love Thing, his EP from 2014, included the song "Fires Out", which debuted at #52 of Billboard's Country Indicator,[7] and was a Top 40 Music Row hit,[8] and "Great Minds Drink Alike," which debuted at #58 and has remained his most popular song on YouTube with a video featuring fan footage.[2][9][10]
In 2017, Monroe toured the country promoting his new work.[1] He released his six-track EP Gypsy Soul on May 12, 2017.[11] The first single was "This Side of You", which made the Music Row Country Breakout Chart.[12][13] The song went to the charts during the second week of its release. Monroe was one of the few independent artists given a spot on a sanctioned CMA stage during the 2017 CMA Music Festival.[14]
Monroe has performed in 17 countries, and every U.S. state except for Oregon.[15] He played with artists such as Lee Brice, Aaron Lewis, Eric Church, Charlie Daniels, Dwight Yoakam, Montgomery Gentry, Patty Loveless, Trick Pony, Emerson Drive, Pat Green, Randy Houser, and Josh Thompson. In 2016 alone, he traveled over 100,000 miles and played over 120 shows.[14] He was the Brand Ambassador at seven consecutive Jägermeister Country Tours.[8]
Monroe writes most of his own songs.[2] He has been described as playing "fast and loose country music about cars and beers, tinged with a big rock 'n' roll sound"[16] and singing with a "memorable blues-infused vocal."[17]

Private life[edit]
He is active in humanitarian causes such as Safe Haven Family Shelter, the Frank Foundation, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and the Children's Miracle Network.[2]

Discography[edit]
Rick Monroe released five studio albums, one live album, two EPs, and several singles. He has also composed for other singers.[18][19]
