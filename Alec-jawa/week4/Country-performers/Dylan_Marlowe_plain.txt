Dylan Marlowe is an American country music singer-songwriter from Statesboro, Georgia signed to Sony Music Nashville.[1]


Background[edit]
Marlowe relocated to Nashville, Tennessee shortly before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and signed a publishing and artist development deal with Play It Again Entertainment in 2020.[1] Following several self-released songs, a growing social media presence, and scoring his first Number One hit as a songwriter with Jon Pardi's "Last Night Lonely",[2] it was announced in January 2023, that Marlowe had signed a recording contract with Sony Music Nashville.[1] His debut EP with the label, Dirt Road When I Die, was released on July 7, 2023.[3] Marlowe's debut single to country radio, "Boys Back Home" (a duet with Dylan Scott), was released on December 4, 2023.[4] Originally recorded in 2021, its release was delayed due to Scott's Livin' My Best Life, and Marlowe had to later re-record his vocals when the label decided to issue it as his debut single instead of "Record High".[2] Marlowe's debut studio album, Mid-Twenties Crisis, will be released on September 27, 2024.[5]
