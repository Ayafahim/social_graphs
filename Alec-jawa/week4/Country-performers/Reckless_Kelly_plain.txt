Reckless Kelly is a 1993 Australian comedy film produced, written, directed and starring Yahoo Serious. It co-stars Melora Hardin, Alexei Sayle and Hugo Weaving. The story is a satirical take on a modern-day Ned Kelly, a famous Australian outlaw.


Synopsis[edit]
A modern-day Ned Kelly robs banks in Australia and gives all the money to the poor people. Ned is forced to go to Hollywood to make enough money to save his family's land. As it goes against his belief, he cannot simply rob banks there for his own benefit. Ned is forced to find another way to come up with the $1 million required to save his family island. That is when a movie producer shows up and gives Ned an offer he cannot refuse.

Production[edit]
The film was financed by Warner Bros, Village Roadshow and the Australian Film Finance Corporation. Serious used many of the same key creatives he had on Young Einstein.[3]

Reception[edit]
Neil Jillett, film critic for The Age wrote, "There are some good gags along the way, and a few of the plot's twists have an entertainingly surreal zaniness. But there is much heavy going too. Most of the messages Serious loads into the film—protect the environment, hate violence and banks, mock the British, go for a republic, sneer at American fads and religious hypocrisy—are presented with a smugness that was missing from Young Einstein".[4]

Box office[edit]
Reckless Kelly opened at number one at the Australian box office with a gross of $2,036,224.[5] It remained at number one for a second week and went on to gross $5,444,534 at the Australian box office.[6][7]

In popular culture[edit]
Australian rock duo Divinyls covered the song "Wild Thing" in 1993 for the soundtrack to the film. It peaked at No. 39 on the Australian Singles Chart.[8]
