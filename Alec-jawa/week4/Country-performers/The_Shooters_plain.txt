The Shooters was a five-piece country music band founded in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. It consisted of Walt Aldridge (lead vocals, guitar), Gary Baker (bass guitar), Barry Billings (guitar), Chalmers Davis (keyboards), and Michael Dillon ([drums). They charted several times on the Billboard country charts between 1986 and 1989.[2] The quintet's first four singles were to have been included on an album titled Going Against the Wind.[3] 1989's Solid as a Rock included their highest-charting single, the number 13 "Borderline".[1]
After disbanding, Aldridge worked as a songwriter and record producer, while Baker joined songwriting partner Frank J. Myers to write John Michael Montgomery's 1994 hit single "I Swear",[2] which was later covered by All-4-One as well. Baker and Myers also recorded one album as the duo Baker & Myers. Chalmers Davis died on September 14, 2024 aged 73.
