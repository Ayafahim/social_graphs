Biography[edit]
Early years[edit]
Steve Forde was born in the regional farming centre of Cowra, New South Wales in 1977. Steve spent most of his early childhood moving from town to town across NSW with his family. He is a singer, a songwriter and a touring country star. Although retired now, Steve was a successful bull rider and bareback bronc rider.[citation needed]
At 18 years old, Ford joined his first band and tasted the life of a touring country musician. It was also during this time that Forde decided that he wanted to join the rodeo as a bull rider.[citation needed]
When he left for the United States in 1998 he joined a country band in Texas and toured through Colorado, South Dakota and into Canada. When the gigs were lean he would work in bars, building fences or riding bareback broncos in Lubbock, Texas.[citation needed]
Steve returned to Australia when his father needed help on the farm; he continued with the rodeos during weekends. He bought his farm, near Grenfell, New South Wales and set about getting it cleaned up, stocked up and productive while still helping at his father's farm; and finding time to continue riding broncos.[citation needed]

2000-present: Recording years[edit]
In 2000, Steve started his band The Flange whose debut album Livin' Right was released in May 2002. At the 2003 Country Music Awards of Australia, the band were nominated in two categories. The single "What I’m talking about" spent twenty-six weeks in the CMC top twenty.[citation needed]
The band's second album, Wild Ride was recorded in Nashville in December 2003 and released in 2004.[citation needed]
