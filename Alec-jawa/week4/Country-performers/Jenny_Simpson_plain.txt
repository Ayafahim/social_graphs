Simpson is a former American record holder for the 3000 metres steeplechase. She represented the United States at the 2008 Beijing, 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics. She was the 2014 Diamond League 1500 m winner. Simpson won 11 individual American national titles. She is a four-time individual NCAA Division I champion.


Running career[edit]
High school[edit]
As a student at Oviedo High School, Jenny Barringer was a 5-time state champion in track and 3-time state champion in cross country.[1] On 3 February 2018, Oviedo High School renamed their track Jenny Simpson Track in her honor.[2] She also set Florida high school records in the mile, two-mile, 5000 m, and three-mile. Barringer finished 3rd in San Diego's Foot Locker Cross Country Championships in 2003 behind winner Katelyn Kaltenbach of Colorado and Marie Lawrence of Nevada.[3][4] In the regional, Barringer came on strong and won for the second straight year in identical times of 17:27, becoming the first Florida girl to ever win the Footlocker South regional twice.[5] She finished 10th in San Diego's Footlocker cross country national championship in 2004.[6][7]

Collegiate[edit]
At Colorado, Barringer won the 2006 NCAA Outdoor championship steeplechase in a time of 9:53.04. The following year, she won the USATF Outdoor steeplechase championship in 9:34.64.
She finished 7th in heats at IAAF World Outdoors in the steeplechase in a time of 9:51.04. She finished 7th at the NCAA Outdoors in 2007 in the steeplechase with a time of 9:59.81. She also ran at Drake Relays in the steeplechase in a time of 9:44.31. In April 2007, she finished 4th in 5,000m at Stanford in a time of 15:48.24.[8]
At the time of her 2008 Olympic appearance, Barringer was enrolled at the University of Colorado. At the U.S. trials, Barringer qualified for the United States Olympic team by finishing third in the steeplechase.[9]
Barringer qualified for the first women's steeplechase final in Olympic history by finishing third in her heat. She set a new American record of 9:22.26 in the final and placed ninth.[10]
In 2009, she set NCAA records in the mile, 3000 m, and 5000 m indoors, 1500 m, 3000 m steeplechase and 5000 m outdoors.[10]  She also topped her own American record in the steeplechase at the 2009 World Championships with a time of 9:12:50, finishing 5th overall.[11]
While primarily a steeplechaser, she ran 3:59.90 in the 1500 m at the 2009 Prefontaine Classic. At the time of the event, this performance made her the third-fastest female 1500 m runner in U.S. track and field history.[12]
Barringer came fifth at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, running a North American record time of 9:12.50 minutes for the event. It is also the best mark by any athlete from the Americas. She was the 2009 US Champion in the steeplechase.
While at Colorado, she won the Honda Sports Award as the nation's best collegiate female track and field athlete in 2009.[13][14]
Despite the fact that she could have signed a professional contract, Barringer returned to school in the fall of 2009 to compete in cross country.[15]  On October 31, 2009, Barringer captured the Big 12 individual title,  running a 6-kilometer course in 20 minutes, 27.46 seconds.[16]  She was favored to win the NCAA Cross Country Championship on November 23, 2009, but collapsed after leading for the first two miles. She wound up in 163rd place.  Barringer commented that she felt light headed all of a sudden.[17]
Barringer won the Inaugural Bowerman Award in 2009. The Bowerman Award is given to college track's Athlete of the Year.[18]

Professional[edit]
In January 2010, Barringer signed a multi-year endorsement deal with New Balance.[19]  Barringer later changed coaches from her  University of Colorado at Boulder coach, Mark Wetmore, in favor of the Air Force Academy coach Juli Benson.[20]
Barringer missed most of the 2010 season due to a stress reaction in her right femur.[21] She married runner[22] Jason Simpson[23] on October 8, 2010, taking on Simpson as her last name from that date.[24]
Simpson began the 2011 season strong, winning the mile and 3000 meters championships at the 2011 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships.[25]   She qualified for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics by finishing second in the 1500 meters at the US Track and Field Championship.[26]
Simpson won a gold medal at the 1500 meters at the  World Championships in a time of 4:05:40. She beat rivals Hannah England and Natalia Rodriguez.  Simpson's gold medal was considered a surprise.[27][28] She became the first American woman to win the event since Mary Decker at the inaugural World Championships in 1983.
On July 1, 2012, Simpson qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics with a third-place finish in the women's 1500 m at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials.[29]  At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Simpson qualified for the 1500 meter semifinal in 4:13.89 but did not qualify for the final.
