A performing highlight of her childhood was a solo appearance at the Southern Baptist Convention national conference at the age of 12, where she performed the Evie song "Four Feet Eleven". The chorus begins, "I'm only 4 feet 11, but I'm going to Heaven" (Chenoweth is 4 ft 11 in (150 cm) in height).[10]  After graduating from Broken Arrow Senior High School, where she participated in school plays, Chenoweth attended Oklahoma City University, where she was a member of Gamma Phi Beta (Beta Omicron) sorority.[11] She earned a bachelor's degree in musical theatre in 1990[12][13] and a master's degree in opera performance in 1992,[13][14] studying under voice instructor and mentor, Florence Birdwell.[12][15] While at OCU, Chenoweth competed in beauty pageants, winning the title of Miss OCU and was the second runner-up in the Miss Oklahoma pageant in 1991.[10][16] In 1992, Chenoweth participated in a studio recording of The Most Happy Fella.[17]

The vocal vocabulary she deploys here ranges from jazz-baby brass to operatic silver, often in a single number, and she switches among them with jaw-dropping ease. And every perfectly weighted note is set off by an impeccably exaggerated gesture."[55] She was nominated for a Tony Award and won another Drama Desk Award for her performance.[56][57] In November 2023, Chenoweth made a cameo appearance in Gutenberg! The Musical! as The Producer[58] She co-produced and stars as the title character, Jackie Siegel, in the musical The Queen of Versailles, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, which premiered at Colonial Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts, in July 2024.[59][60]

In 2013, Chenoweth co-hosted the Oscars Red Carpet Live immediately prior to the 85th Academy Awards[188] and also sang the closing number of the ceremony, "Here's to the Losers", with host Seth MacFarlane, in which, paraphrasing the original Frank Sinatra song, the two poked genial fun at nominees who had not received awards.[189] Chenoweth was the solo performer in the Live from Lincoln Center feature "The Dames of Broadway... All of 'Em!!!"[28] In July, she hosted the fifth Just For Laughs gala in Montreal.[190] She also appeared in the 2013 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade performing the song "New York, New York" while riding aboard Royal Caribbean's "A World at Sea" float.[191]
In 2015, she co-hosted the Tony Awards.[192] She appeared as a guest with Andrea Bocelli on some of his 2017–2018 American tour stops.[193] In December 2018, Chenoweth performed with and narrated the Tabernacle Choir's yearly Christmas concert series in Salt Lake City, Utah.[194]

Personal life[edit]
Chenoweth sang the U.S. national anthem for the Yankees' home opener in 2010.
In 2009, Chenoweth published a memoir, A Little Bit Wicked: Life, Love, and Faith in Stages, describing her life and career, including her adoption, her turn in Wicked and her time in Hollywood.[195] Chenoweth suffers from Ménière's disease, an inner-ear disorder that can cause vertigo, headaches and nausea, among other symptoms. She has said that during some performances, she leaned on her co-stars to keep her balance, and that it has caused her to miss performances.[12]
Chenoweth has spoken publicly about her religious faith; she describes herself as a "non-judgmental, liberal Christian".[196] According to The New York Times, when Chenoweth "assured her theater fans that she supports gay rights, her Christian base was outraged; she was disinvited from performing at a Women of Faith conference in September 2005".[197] Chenoweth released an album in April 2005, As I Am, a mixture of hymns and contemporary Christian music, with adult contemporary arrangements. To promote the album, she made an appearance on The 700 Club, which upset some of her gay fans.[198] She later said she thought that the "Pat Robertsons and Jerry Falwells of the world are scary" and that she regretted appearing on the show.[199]
In May 2010, Chenoweth wrote in response to an article in Newsweek by Ramin Setoodeh, an openly gay writer. Setoodeh thought that her Tony-nominated Promises, Promises co-star, Sean Hayes, "comes off as wooden and insincere" in playing the straight character Chuck and that Jonathan Groff has a similar credibility problem in the TV show Glee. He questioned whether any openly gay actor could acceptably portray a straight character.[200] Chenoweth called the article "horrendously homophobic" and criticized Setoodeh's view as rationalizing "the same kind of bullying" that gay youths face in high school. Chenoweth argued that audiences "come to the theater to go on a journey" and do not care about an actor's sexual orientation.[201] The story was discussed in media including The New York Times[202] and the Los Angeles Times.[203]
Chenoweth has dated several men in Hollywood, including producer Dana Brunetti,[204] actors Seth Green, Lane Garrison and Marc Kudisch (to whom she was engaged from 1998 to 2001),[205] and producer/writer Aaron Sorkin.[206] In Sorkin's Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, the character of the Christian Harriet Hayes bears significant resemblances to Chenoweth, and the relationship between Hayes and "East coast liberal Jewish atheist" (Hayes' description) Matt Albie is modeled after that of Chenoweth and Sorkin. For example, Chenoweth's decision to appear on The 700 Club and her falling out with Women of Faith were depicted with the Hayes character.[12][207] In 2018, Chenoweth began dating Josh Bryant, the guitarist for country band Backroad Anthem.[208] They became engaged in 2021[209] and were married on September 2, 2023.[210]
