She said, "My parents are Albanian, and people started calling me 'Bebe' for short."[6] She and her family moved to nearby Staten Island when she was six.[18] Rexha has a brother named Florent.[19][20]
Rexha took trumpet lessons and later taught herself to play guitar and piano.[21][22] She attended Tottenville High School in Staten Island. Rexha sang in the choir there and took part in a variety of musicals.[23][9][17][22] While in high school choir, she discovered that she is a coloratura soprano.[24][25] Rexha cites Coldplay, the Cranberries, Lauryn Hill, Alanis Morissette, and Kanye West as being musical influences.[26][27]
As a teenager, she submitted a song to be performed at the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences' annual "Grammy Career Day" event. Rexha earned the "Best Teen Songwriter" award; about 700 were in the competition.[18][28][29] As a result, she signed a contract with talent scout Samantha Cox, who encouraged her to enroll in songwriting classes in Manhattan.[21][30]
