Musical career[edit]
Christopher Pierre Janson was born on April 2, 1986, in Perryville, Missouri. He moved to Nashville, Tennessee, after finishing high school.[2]
In June 2009, Janson co-wrote and recorded two duets with Holly Williams on her album Here with Me: "I Hold On" and "A Love I Think Will Last."[3] Janson signed to BNA Records in October 2009[4] and released his debut single, "'Til a Woman Comes Along," in April 2010. Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the single a five-star rating, with his review praising Janson's vocals as well as the arrangement.[5] The song debuted at No. 56 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts dated for the week ending May 1, 2010.[6]
After BNA was restructured, Janson left the label.[2] He co-wrote Tim McGraw's 2012 single "Truck Yeah,"[7] played harmonica on the track "Beer" from Lee Brice's album Hard 2 Love,[8] and wrote the title track to Justin Moore's 2013 album Off the Beaten Path.
In 2013, he signed to Bigger Picture Music Group and released "Better I Don't."[9] Janson wrote the song with his wife, Kelly, and Pat Bunch,[10] and Keith Stegall produced it.[2] "Better I Don't" peaked at number 40 on Country Airplay in mid-2013. A second single, "Cut Me Some Slack," peaked at number 60 before Bigger Picture closed in 2014. That same year, Columbia Records released Take It to the Bank, which included "Til a Woman Comes Along" and other songs that he had recorded while on BNA.

Chris Janson in 2017
Janson self-released the single "Buy Me a Boat" in early 2015. The song debuted at No. 33 on Hot Country Songs after it received airplay on the Bobby Bones Show.[2][11] It was officially released as a single via Warner Records Nashville in May 2015,[12] and became Janson's first top-5 hit by August. In September, Janson announced that his debut studio album (also titled Buy Me a Boat)  would be released on October 30.[13] "Buy Me a Boat" peaked at No. 3 on Country Airplay and No. 1 on Mediabase.[14] The album also includes the singles "Power of Positive Drinkin'" and "Holdin' Her". Also, in 2015, Janson co-wrote LoCash's "I Love This Life."[15] Also, in 2016, Janson co-wrote Randy Houser's "Song Number 7."
Janson performed on the third day of the 2016 Republican National Convention.[16]
Janson's second album for Warner Nashville, Everybody, was released in September 2017. Its lead single is "Fix a Drink", which was followed in 2018 by "Drunk Girl".[2] His next album was 2019's Real Friends, which accounted for the number-one singles "Good Vibes" and "Done".[2] Jansons All In, was his fourth and final album with Warner before starting his own imprint "Harpeth 60 Records" with Nashville Harbor Records & Entertainment in 2022.[17]
