Collins Obinna Chibueze (born May 9, 1995), known professionally as Shaboozey, is an American musician, singer, songwriter, filmmaker, and record producer.[2][3] He gained initial attention for his 2018 song "Start a Riot" (with Duckwrth), which was included on the soundtrack to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.[4][1] In 2024, he collaborated with Beyoncé on two tracks from her eighth studio album, Cowboy Carter.[5] That same year, he released the country single "A Bar Song (Tipsy)", which peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100.


Early life[edit]
Chibueze was born in northern Virginia to Nigerian parents and raised in Woodbridge.[6] His stage name is derived from mispronunciations of his surname, meaning "God is king" in Igbo.[6][5] In his childhood, he was inspired by watching music videos on 106 & Park, as well as his time at a boarding school in Nigeria for junior high.[7][2]

Career[edit]
In 2014, Shaboozey released his first single, "Jeff Gordon".[2] That same year, he founded the production company V Picture Films.[8][7] He was signed to Republic Records in 2017 after catching their attention with singles "Starfoxx" and "Robert Plant", and released his debut studio album, Lady Wrangler, the following year.[2] His second studio album, Cowboys Live Forever, Outlaws Never Die, was released in October 2022 through Empire Distribution.[2][9] His third studio album, Where I've Been, Isn't Where I'm Going, was released on May 31, 2024, which he will promote with headlining shows in the US, as well as a slot as an opening act for Jessie Murph on tour.[3] Though his earlier music had more of a trap influence, his later songs have more of a folk-pop sound with acoustic guitar.[5]

Musical style and influences[edit]
His music combines hip hop, country, rock, and Americana.[3][10][7]
In an interview with ColorsxStudios, Shaboozey cites the Rolling Stones, Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan, and Led Zeppelin as influences, as well as Martin Scorsese films such as Taxi Driver.[7] Other influences include Fela Kuti, Clipse, Roger Waters, Backstreet Boys, Pharrell Williams, Missy Elliott, Lead Belly, and Johnny Cash.[2][7][4]
