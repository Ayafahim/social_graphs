The Del McCoury Band is a Grammy award-winning American bluegrass band.


History[edit]
Originally the band was called Del McCoury and the Dixie Pals with Del on guitar and his brother Jerry on bass. The band went through a number of changes in personnel until the 1980s when the band solidified its line-up, adding McCoury's sons, Ronnie and Robbie on mandolin and banjo, respectively.[1] In 1988, the "Dixie Pals" name was dropped in favor of the current name. Fiddler Tad Marks and bass player Mike Brantley joined in the early 1990s while the band became a national touring act.[2] The addition of fiddler Jason Carter and bassist Mike Bub in 1992 created a lineup that was unchanged for 13 years. Bub left the band in 2005 and was replaced by Alan Bartram.

Awards[edit]
In 1999 the Del McCoury band was named "Entertainer of the Year" at the International Bluegrass Music Awards.[3]
In 2004 they were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album for It's Just the Night,[4] and in 2006 they won that category for The Company We Keep.[5]

Collaborations[edit]
The band recorded with Steve Earle on "I Still Carry You Around" on his 1997 album El Corazón.[6] They shared co-billing on his 1999 album The Mountain.[7]
The band has also often performed in recent years with the Lee Boys, with setlists mixing bluegrass, funk and gospel with extended jams on many songs.[8]

Travelin' McCourys[edit]
The Travelin' McCourys are an offshoot of the Del McCoury Band, featuring all current (2009) members of the band minus Del, augmented by guitarist Cody Kilby on live performances.[9]
The Travelin' McCourys also often play joint concerts with the Lee Boys.[8]
