Rasie Michael Bailey (February 14, 1939 – August 4, 2021), better known as Razzy Bailey, was an American country music singer-songwriter and musician. In the early 1980s, he scored 5 No. 1's on the Billboard country music charts.


Early life[edit]
Bailey was born in Five Points, Alabama, United States,[2] and raised on a farm in La Fayette, Alabama. Bailey got his first experience of musical performance as a member of his high school's Future Farmers of America string band. After graduation, he married and had children immediately and had little time to pursue his career,[3] but he spent many years playing occasional gigs at honkytonks in Georgia and Alabama and developing his songwriting.

Early releases[edit]
In 1966, Bailey took his material to Bill Lowery at Atlantic Records, who arranged for him to record "9,999,999 Tears" backed by a studio band featuring Billy Joe Royal, Joe South, and Freddy Weller.[2] The song failed to hit the charts at that time, but Bailey was encouraged, forming the pop trio Daily Bread which released a pair of albums on small labels.[3] Another group, The Aquarians, followed in 1972; in 1974, Bailey recorded the album I Hate Hate simply as "Razzy." It sold over half a million copies before being picked up by MGM Records. 

Career at RCA[edit]
In 1976, Dickey Lee recorded "9,999,999 Tears", and it became a country and pop hit in 1976,[2] and in 1977, Lee repeated this with another Bailey tune, "Peanut Butter," which also went into the charts.[3] As his songwriting talents became known, Bailey signed with RCA Records and, in 1978, began releasing singles of his own songs.[3] His first hit as a singer-songwriter, "What Time Do You Have To Be Back in Heaven?",[2] was on the charts for over four months. Bailey charted a total of seven No. 1 singles on Billboard's "Country" charts and another eight Top 10 in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His sound combines R&B influences with country; his version of Wilson Pickett's "In the Midnight Hour" was a country hit.[2] His last country No. 1 hit was with "She Left Love All Over Me" in 1982.[2]
Bailey had three double sided number 1's in succession on the Country chart,[2] a feat never accomplished by any other artist.
He also operated Razzy's Hit House, his recording studio where he helped other artists with their projects.

Personal life[edit]
Bailey died in August 2021, at the age of 82.[4]
