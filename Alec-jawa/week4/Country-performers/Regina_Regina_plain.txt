Regina Regina was an American country music duo formed in 1995. The duo consisted of female singers Regina Leigh and Regina Nicks, respectively natives of North Carolina and Lufkin, Texas.[1] Leigh was formerly a backing vocalist in Reba McEntire's road band, while Nicks was a personal assistant for McEntire and a former member of Dave & Sugar.[2] The two met through the assistance of producer Wally Wilson, who wanted to include Nicks in a female duo. Nicks felt that she was unable to find a suitable singing partner until Leigh heard one of her demos and decided that she wanted to work with Nicks. The two were brought to Giant Records then-president James Stroud in 1995.[3]
Regina Regina released its only album in 1997. The duo's only charting single in the U.S. was "More Than I Wanted to Know", which peaked at No. 53 on Billboard's Hot Country Singles & Tracks.[1]
