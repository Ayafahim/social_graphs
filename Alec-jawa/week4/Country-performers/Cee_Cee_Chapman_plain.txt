Cee Cee Chapman (born Melissa Carol Chapman on December 13, 1958 in Portsmouth, Virginia[1]) is an American country music singer-songwriter. Chapman was signed to Curb Records.[2] She charted five singles on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.[1]
Chapman was nominated for Top New Female Vocalist at the 1988 Academy of Country Music Awards.[3] She was also nominated for Favorite Country New Artist at the American Music Awards of 1990.[4]
Jack Hurst of the Chicago Tribune gave Chapman's eponymous second album three stars out of four, calling her a "straight-ahead singer" who "attacks almost any kind of song here with obvious personal involvement that is often stunning."[5] The album also received a favorable review from People, which stated that it was "characterized by intelligent song selection" and that Chapman "at times [sounds] like Cher gone down-home."[6]
