2007–2008
Brownlee was a draft pick for the Vancouver Canucks in 2003, going in the sixth round No. 190th overall.[1] After four years of playing for the NCAA's Minnesota State Mavericks (located in Mankato, Minn.), Brownlee made his professional debut with the ECHL's Idaho Steelheads playing a lone season with the club in the 2007–08 season before ending his playing career.[1]

Music career[edit]
Following a series of injuries, he turned his attention to music the following year.[1] His first single, "The Best That I Can (Superhero)", was released in November 2009. Brownlee's self-titled debut album, produced by Mitch Merrett, was released in August 2010 via MDM Recordings.[2] He followed it up with Love Me or Leave Me in 2012. Brownlee was nominated for a Juno Award for Country Album of the Year on February 19, 2013. The awards took place on April 21 in Regina, Saskatchewan.[3] Brownlee's third album, The Fighters, was released on June 3, 2014.[4]
Brownlee landed his first No. 1 hit with "Forever's Gotta Start Somewhere" in April 2019.[5] It was included on the EP Back in the Game, which was released on June 21, 2019, via Universal Music Canada.[6] Brownlee extended that to become his fourth album on January 10, 2020.[7] A July 2020 Nielsen Music study found Brownlee to be the eighth-highest played Canadian artist on domestic radio in the first half of 2020, ahead of Brett Kissel and JP Saxe, and behind Dallas Smith and Drake.[8]
In 2023, Brownlee ended a prolonged hiatus and released the single "The Country Kind".[9]

Acting career[edit]
Brownlee's first role as an actor came in 2010 film Tooth Fairy as an unnamed hockey player with no lines.[10] He appeared in the 2021 film Range Roads as Bruce, the ex-boyfriend of the main character Frankie.[10]
