Franklin Delano Reeves (July 14, 1932 – January 1, 2007)[1] was an American country music singer, best known for his "girl-watching" novelty songs of the 1960s including "Girl on the Billboard" and "The Belles of Southern Bell". He is also known for his 1968 trucker's anthem, "Looking at the World Through a Windshield", which demonstrated he was capable of more than just novelty songs. He became one of the most successful male country singers of the 1960s.


Early life[edit]
Reeves was born in Sparta, North Carolina, in July 1932 , United States, the youngest of 11 children.[2] He was named after U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.[3] While his older brothers served in World War II, Reeves learned how to play their musical instruments.[2] By age 12, Reeves began performing on the Merry Go Round Show on local radio station WPAQ.[3][4]
After high school, Reeves briefly attended Appalachian State College (now University). He later enlisted in the United States Air Force, stationed at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California.[4]

Music career[edit]
1950s[edit]
After completing his military service, Reeves began performing regularly on Chester Smith's radio show on Modesto station KTRB around 1955.[5][6] Reeves made his first rockabilly recordings with Capitol Records from 1957 to 1958.[7][8]
In 1958, Reeves began hosting a television variety show on Stockton station KOVR.[8]

1960s–2000s[edit]
In 1961, Reeves signed with Decca Records and recorded the song that would become his first charting single, "Be Quiet Mind".[2] Moving to Nashville in 1962, Reeves and wife Ellen Schiell co-wrote "Sing a Little Song of Heartache", a top five hit for Rose Maddox that year.[4][9]
After stints with Reprise Records in 1963 and Columbia Records in 1964, Reeves signed with United Artists Records.[9] Reeves became known as "The Doodle-Oo-Doo-Doo Kid" for the sound effect he added to his songs.[10]
Under United Artists, he had his first number-one hit with "The Girl on the Billboard" in 1965.[2] His follow-up, "The Belles of the Southern Bell", made the country top five.[2] His success continued throughout the rest of the 1960s. Songs that became hits during this time are "Be Glad" and "Good Time Charlie's".[2] In the late 1960s, he appeared in several Hollywood films, including a starring role in Cottonpickin' Chickenpickers, and a supporting role in Burt Reynolds' first big movie Sam Whiskey.[4][9]
In the 1970s, he released a series of duets with Bobby Goldsboro and Penny DeHaven. He also returned to television, hosting the syndicated TV program, Del Reeves' Country Carnival.[2]
His last big hit was "The Philadelphia Fillies".  His career declined in the mid-1970s, and then started to slowly move away from country music, although he recorded some duets with Billie Jo Spears in 1976.[2] He had hit songs on the country chart most years until 1982.
In 1979, Reeves left his musical career to pursue a career as a music executive; he would eventually help Billy Ray Cyrus score his first major record deal.[2] He continued to record in the 1980s on a reduced scale for smaller labels.
