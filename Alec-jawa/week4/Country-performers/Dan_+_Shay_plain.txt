The duo has cited many musical influences. Dan Smyers cited artists such as Ryan Adams, Tom Petty, Kenny Chesney and Alison Krauss as musical influences.[14] Shay Mooney cited artists such as Rascal Flatts, Dave Matthews Band, Usher and Kenny Chesney as musical influences.[14] Billboard noted musical influences from The Beach Boys, Electric Light Orchestra, Alan Jackson and Brooks & Dunn on the duo's fourth album, Good Things.[86] According to Dan Smyers in an interview:

"We write country songs — the topline, the lyrics of these songs...We grew up listening to all kinds of music, not just country but pop, rock, R&B, hip-hop, everything… and you hear that in the music."[86]
