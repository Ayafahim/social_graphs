Janette Carter (July 2, 1923 – January 22, 2006),[1] daughter of musicians A.P. and Sara Carter, was an American musician involved in the preservation of Appalachian music.
Carter was born on July 2, 1923, in Maces Spring, Virginia.[2] She and her brother Joe performed with their parents on a series of recordings for the Acme label.[3] Janette and Joe later recorded material together consisting of works they had written and songs previously recorded by members of the Carter family.[4]
In 1976, Carter and community members built an 880-seat amphitheater, the Carter Family Fold, beside the A. P. Carter Store which her father had operated after the Carter Family had disbanded as a musical group. The Carter Family Fold attracts more than 50,000 visitors a year.[5] Carter performed there weekly, until shortly before she died.[6]
Carter had three children with her first husband, James Jett: Donald William, Rita Janette, and James Delaney (Dale).[7] She died on January 22, 2006, in Kingsport, Tennessee, after battling Parkinson's disease and other illnesses.[8] She was buried next to her mother, Sara Carter Bayes, and her brother, Joe, at the Mount Vernon United Methodist Church Cemetery in Maces Spring.
