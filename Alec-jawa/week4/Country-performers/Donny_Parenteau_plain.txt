Donny Parenteau (born in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan) is singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer.  He is best for known his solo career and his work as fiddle player, guitarist, and mandolin player for country music singer Neal McCoy.  In February 2011, Parenteau signed with the record label 306 Records/EMI Music Canada to help distribute his albums.[2]


Early life[edit]
At 14, Parenteau took up the fiddle.  After mastering the fiddle, he picked up other instruments like the guitar (both acoustic and electric) and the mandolin (both acoustic and electric).  Parenteau cites some of his influences as Bryan Sklar,[1] Freddie Pelltier,[1] and George Pistun[1]

Career[edit]
After picking up the violin at a young age, by 19 he was playing professionally.[1] In 1991, Parenteau was playing in Edmonton, Alberta and was invited to a show by Neal McCoy who was also playing in Edmonton.[1] Upon talking with McCoy, Parenteau discovered they had similar taste in music.[1] McCoy was looking for a fiddle player, but didn't have the money to hire one.  Parenteau wanted the chance to audition and would not let up until he got the chance to audition.  Parenteau listened to the group jamming and had a grasp of what they were playing.  It was that song he would use as the audition piece.[1] During his time touring with McCoy, Parenteau got to open for such artists as Merle Haggard,[1] Tim McGraw,[1] Faith Hill,[1] Buck Owens,[1] George Jones,[1] Charlie Pride,[1] Loretta Lynn,[1] Charlie Daniels,[1] Hank Williams, Jr.,[1] Reba McEntire,[1] Garth Brooks,[1] and Shania Twain.[1] Parenteau also graced the Grand Ole Opry stage.[1] Parenteau was the only member of the live band that was also on the recordings.[1] After performing with Neal McCoy for 12 years and playing 250–300 shows a year, Parenteau returned to Prince Albert to embark on a solo career.[1]

Charity work[edit]
Parenteau has done a number of humanitarian and charity work.  In 2001 SCMA International Humanitarian Award for his efforts.  He also appears on Telemiracle starting on the 32nd edition of the telethon.  Parenteau co-wrote the current Telemiracle opening theme song with Brad Johner entitled "You are the Miracle".  It became the theme in 2011.  He also embarks on a tour of elementary schools in Saskatchewan each year as a motivational speaker in which he spreads his message of anti-bullying.

Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.
