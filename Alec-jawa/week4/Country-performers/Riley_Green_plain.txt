Riley Green (born October 18, 1988) is an American country music singer and songwriter. Signed to Nashville Harbor Records & Entertainment (formerly BMLG) since 2019, he has released two albums: Different 'Round Here in 2019 and Ain't My Last Rodeo in 2023. Green has charted four top-20 hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts: "There Was This Girl", "I Wish Grandpas Never Died", "Half of Me" (with Thomas Rhett), and "Different 'Round Here" (with Luke Combs).


Music career[edit]
Before he was a recording artist, Green was a Division 1 FCS Quarterback on the  Jacksonville State University football team. Green was also a contestant on the CMT reality show Redneck Island. He released a self-titled EP in 2013, followed by additional EPs in 2015, 2016, and 2017. In 2018, he signed to the Big Machine Label Group.[1][2]
Billy Dukes of Taste of Country reviewed "There Was This Girl" favorably, comparing its theme to "Chicks Dig It" by Chris Cagle and noting the more neotraditional country influence compared to Green's peers.[3] The song charted on Country Airplay, and a music video was shot in October 2018.[4]
In April 2019, Green announced the release of his second single, "In Love by Now", co-written with Rhett Akins, Ben Hayslip, and Marv Green, and released an accompanying music video shot in Belize.[5][6]
"I Wish Grandpas Never Died" was released in August 2019 as the third single from Green's debut album, Different 'Round Here, which was released on September 20, 2019.[7]
The Academy of Country Music presented Riley Green with the New Male Artist of the Year Award for 2019.[8]
He collaborated on a song with Justin Moore for his 2023 album, Stray Dog.[9]
