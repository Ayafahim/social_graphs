Krystal Ladawn Covel Sandubrae, known professionally as Krystal Keith (born September 30, 1985) is an American country music singer. 


Early life[edit]
Keith was born on September 30, 1985, to fellow country singer Toby Keith[4] and Tricia Covel (n√©e Lucus). She has one younger brother, Stelen Keith Covel,[5] and one maternal half-sister, *Shelley Covel Rowland, who was adopted by Toby upon his marriage to their mother.

Career[edit]
Keith's first chart entry was in 2004, when she sang duet vocals with her father on a cover of Inez and Charlie Foxx's "Mockingbird" which appeared on his 2004 album Greatest Hits 2. The two also performed the song together at the 2004 Country Music Association awards.[6] After this song was released, Keith attended college at her father's insistence. She graduated from the University of Oklahoma.[7]
In mid-2013, Keith signed to Show Dog-Universal Music. She released a four-song extended play, which includes her debut single "Daddy Dance with Me". She wrote the song as a surprise to her father and performed it for the first time on the day of her wedding.[8][9] The song is included on her debut album Whiskey & Lace, produced by her father and Mark Wright.[10] The EP received a positive review from Daryl Addison of Great American Country, who called her a "confident young singer with a strong voice".[7] The second single from Whiskey & Lace, "Get Your Redneck On", was released to country radio on September 30, 2013.

Personal life[edit]
Keith began dating ‚ÄúSandubrae Energy, LLC‚Äù founder and president, Andrew Robert Sandubrae in 2004.[11] They married in 2007 after 3 years of dating.[12][13][14] Together they have two daughters.[15][16]
On May 11, 2024, Keith accepted an honorary degree from the University of Oklahoma on behalf of her father, who died of stomach cancer three months prior.[17]
