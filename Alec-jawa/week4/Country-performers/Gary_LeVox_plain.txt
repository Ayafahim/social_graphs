Gary LeVox (born Gary Wayne Vernon Jr., July 10, 1970) is an American singer and songwriter. He is best known for being the lead vocalist of the contemporary country music band Rascal Flatts,[1] and his stage name was taken from the studio-console label for his lead-vocal track.[2]


Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
LeVox was born in Powell, Ohio.[3] LeVox's first musical performance was at the age of eight, in a play at his church. He graduated from Olentangy High School and is an alumnus of Ohio State University. Prompted by his cousin, LeVox moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1997.[4]

LeVox and his second cousin, Jay DeMarcus, started out together in singer Chely Wright's band. When the regular guitarist was not available, Joe Don Rooney stepped in. The three men say they felt chemistry immediately and afterwards formed Rascal Flatts.[5]

Post-Rascal Flatts[edit]
The band disbanded in 2021, after which LeVox began releasing solo music. In May 2021, he released his first solo EP, One on One.[6] This was followed in 2022 by a single titled "Get Down Like That" on Big Machine Records, the label to which Rascal Flatts was previously signed.[7]

Personal life[edit]
LeVox has been friends with Jamie Foxx since the mid-1990s, and Foxx made a guest appearance on the album Still Feels Good.[5]

"We used to sit around for hours at Jamie’s house, singing and playing and having a good time...So when Jay and Joe and myself wrote this song, we thought it would be great to have him on it. I called him up just to say, ‘Hey, man, you’ve got to hear this song. I think you could really, really kill it.’ He said, ‘Tell you what. I’ll sing on your record if you guys will sing on mine.’ I said, ‘All right.’"— Gary LeVox (2007)[5]
LeVox was employed in his local burger bar from age 14 after which he started an AC/DC cover band with his close childhood friends. 
LeVox has been married to Tara Vernon since May 1999. He says it was love at first sight when they met backstage at a gospel festival concert. "I knew at that moment that I was looking at my future wife," he said in a 2011 interview. "It was the weirdest thing ever." They have two daughters together, Brittany, born in 2000, and Brooklyn, born in 2004.
