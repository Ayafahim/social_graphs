The Sky Kings was an American country music supergroup[1] formed in 1991 as Four Wheel Drive.[2] The band consisted of John Cowan, Bill Lloyd, Patrick Simmons and Rusty Young. They were signed to a recording deal with RCA Nashville and completed an album which for the label was never released.[2]
Warner Bros. Records signed the group in 1993.[2] Threatened with lawsuits from bands who had copyrighted the name Four Wheel Drive, they secured the rights to the name The Sky Kings.[2] After opening for The Doobie Brothers on their 1993 tour, Simmons left The Sky Kings to rejoin The Doobie Brothers.[2] Now a trio, The Sky Kings released three singles on Warner Bros.: "Picture Perfect," "Fooled Around and Fell in Love" (a cover of the Elvin Bishop hit) and "That Just About Says It All."[3] "Picture Perfect" was the only single to chart, peaking at No. 52 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.[4] An eponymous album was scheduled to be released in 1997, but eventually shelved.[5] Rhino Handmade released From Out of the Blue, an album which collected the entire unreleased 1997 Warner Bros. album, non-album Warner Bros. singles, and recordings and demos made for a second unreleased Warner Bros. album, in 2000.[5]
