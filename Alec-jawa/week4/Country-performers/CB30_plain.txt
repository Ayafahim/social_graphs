CB30 is an American country music group composed of brothers Christian (born May 30, 2001) and Brody Clementi (born March 30, 2004).[1] The duo’s name is derived from their first initial of each of their first names and the fact that they were both born on the 30th of the month.[1][2]

While performing at local charity events in Nashville, the duo was discovered by country superstar Luke Bryan[6] who helped them with music industry connections.[2]

In December 2017, CB30 released a cover of the popular Christmas carol “The Christmas Song” and performed the song during ABC’s CMA Country Christmas at the Grand Ole Opry.[2][10]
The duo released their third song "Like It’s A Bad Thing," written by Christian and Jay Clementi and Kevin Bard,[11] in April 2018.[12] They made their debut performance with the song at the 2018 Stagecoach Festival on the SiriusXM Spotlight Stage.[13][14]
In June 2018, CB30 performed during CMA Fest at the Radio Disney Country Stage.[15]
