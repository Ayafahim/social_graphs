Mary Duff is an Irish country, pop and folk singer. 
Duff’s rise to fame began in the 1990s when she was discovered by Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell. O'Donnell invited her to perform with him on his television show, and the rest, as they say, is history. Duff became a regular on the show and soon began touring with Daniel. She quickly gained a reputation as one of the most talented singers in Ireland, and her popularity began to grow beyond the country’s borders.[1]
Duff and O'Donnell parted ways as duo in 2019. Duff is quoted saying on the topic, "I wanted to experiment more with songs and do a wider variety of songs, not necessarily ones that would have suited his audience."[2]


Personal life[edit]
Mary Duff is a private person and keeps her personal life out of the public eye. Mary was married to her manager, Paul McKenna. They are now divorced.[3] They have two children together. Mary is also a devout Catholic and is known for her strong faith.[4]
