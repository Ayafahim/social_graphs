Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
Kyle Park was born in July 1985[2] in Austin, Texas, and was raised in Leander, a small country town[3] north of Austin, where he[4][5] attended Leander High School.[2][6] He listened to country and rock radio in particular, and eventually began focusing on artists such as[6] Clint Black and Chris LeDoux.[3][4]
Park was 12 when his father passed away from a heart attack.[7]
Park started playing guitar at age 14,[3] and wrote his first song and first performed live the next year.[8][2] His music was first played on the radio (KVET 98.1 Austin) when he was 17 years old.[2][6]

Music career[edit]
He has celebrated numerous #1 Texas radio singles from his self-released seven studio albums.[9][10][11] Since 2005, he has performed thousands of shows across North America and Europe, often headlining those events, as well as opening for artists such as George Strait, Clint Black, Willie Nelson, and more. As of 2024, he has independently released: Big Time (2005), Anywhere in Texas (2008), Make Or Break Me (2011), Beggin’ For More (2013), The Blue Roof Sessions (2015), Don’t Forget Where You Come From (2018), and All Nighters (2024).[12]
Park is also a member of Western Swing band The Texas Trio. Formed in 2020, the band consists of Park, Jason Roberts (fiddle, mandolin, guitar, vocals), and John Michael Whitby (piano, vocals). They have one self-titled album.[13]
