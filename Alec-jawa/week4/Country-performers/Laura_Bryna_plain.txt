Biography[edit]
Laura Bryna first gained an interest in country music on road trips to Washington, D.C. while her brother was in a hospital there.[1] After attending Philadelphia's University of the Arts, she starred in a musical called Rasputin and moved to Nashville, Tennessee. There, she got internships at Sony Tree Publishing and DreamWorks Publishing.
Bryna toured with Black in late 2007.[2] To promote her debut album, Bryna broadcast the music video for the single "Make a Wish" on flat-screen monitors in the Luxor and Excalibur Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas for one month.[3] She also performed at the Fashion Show Mall and had 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) images of herself on top of the Luxor's tower. On January 14, she held a release party for the album at the Luxor, and included a bonus track called "I Don't Have a Thing to Wear" on a special edition of the album which was released only at the Luxor and Excalibur.
In April 2008, Bryna joined the board of directors for the Make-A-Wish Foundation of the Mid-Atlantic. She also released another single, "Life Is Good", in early 2008.[4] She has continued to tour and perform at various venues, including a performance at the House of Blues in 2009. In 2010, she became the host of GoTV Networks' True Country show.[5]
In 2022, Bryna released her bold single “Jawbreaker,” kicking off a new era in her career.  “Jawbreaker” spotlights her powerful voice and high-energy musical style, as well as a newfound freedom in her songwriting.[6]
In 2023, Bryna released “Certified,” a rowdy track about warning off any man who would try to outshine her.  The song was supported by more than 100 radio stations and later remixed by fast-rising producer Deerock.  The song made it to the top 50 on both the Mediabase Indicator and MusicRow charts and became a top trending song on the app Shazam.[7]
