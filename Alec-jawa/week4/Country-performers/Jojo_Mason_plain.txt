Jojo Mason (born February 26, 1990) is a Canadian country music singer-songwriter. Mason moved to Victoria, British Columbia in 2004 to play hockey at the junior (Saanich Jr Braves, VIJHL) ranks but suffered a herniated disk.[1] Later, he met songwriter/producer Dan Swinimer and worked on developing his vocals.[1] He signed to Manicdown Productions in 2014 and released his debut single, "It's All Good", in early 2015.[2] It reached the top 10 on the Billboard Canada Country chart.[3] Mason's second single, "Good Kinda Love", was released in November 2015.[4] He signed to 604 Records for the release of his third single, "Red Dress", in May 2016.[citation needed]
