Ryan Embry Beaver (born March 17, 1984)[1] is an American country music singer-songwriter from Emory, Texas.  Born on March 17, 1984, and growing up in East Texas,[2] Beaver moved South and began his musical career while he was attending Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. Beaver currently lives in Nashville, Tennessee.


Career[edit]
Wrote the #1 song "Pretty Little Poison" performed by Warren Zeiders.  It was the first number one for both of them.
Beaver's first album, Under the Neons, was released on February 27, 2008.[3] The album spawned 3 singles for Texas radio: "I Shoulda Kissed You", "Under the Neons", and "Streets of Austin".
Beaver's second album, Constant, was released February 8, 2011.[3]  David Grissom produced the album, with co-write credits for himself, Wade Bowen, Brian Keane, Ben Danaher, and Paul Eason.  "For A While", "Hate", and "Nobody Wants to be Alone" were the singles sent to radio respectively.  "Hate" became Beaver's highest charting single to date (#2 for 3 weeks) on the Texas Music Chart[4] and earned a "Favorite Song of 2011" nod from galleywinter.com.[5]
Country Weekly described his lyrics as "thoughtful, introspective, and extremely well crafted" in their December 10, 2012, issue.[6]
Beaver's first music video for "How About You" was featured on CMT Pure, CMT.com,[7] Yallwire.com,[8] NoDepression.com among others.

Songwriting[edit]
A BMI writer, Beaver co-wrote "Along the Way" and "More Than Willing" with Rob Baird (I Swear It's The Truth released on Carnival Records). He also co-wrote "Day by Day", "Make Or Break Me" and "Leavin' Stephenville" with Kyle Park, the latter two appearing on Park's Make Or Break Me album released in 2011.
