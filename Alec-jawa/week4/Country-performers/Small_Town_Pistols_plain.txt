Small Town Pistols were a Canadian country music duo composed of Amanda and Tyler Wilkinson, formerly of The Wilkinsons.[1]
The two siblings were each pursuing individual solo careers when they both went through difficult break-ups.[2] That led them to start writing music together again with an eye towards pitching songs to other artists[3] including Lady Antebellum.[4] On listening to their new material they decided to perform it themselves. While they did discuss using the Wilkinson name for their new material,[3] they decided to use a fresh name. The name Small Town Pistols is a reference to their having been "raised in a small town of like 14,000 people"[5] while the Pistols is a reference to their grandmother Ida.
Their self-titled debut album was released by 604 Records on February 19, 2013.[6] Its second single, "Living on the Outside," debuted on the Canadian Hot 100 in January 2013.[7]
