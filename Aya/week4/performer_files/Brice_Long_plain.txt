Biography[edit]
Brice Long was born and raised in Hopkinsville, Kentucky.[2] In the 1990s, he pursued a career in the rodeo, until his father persuaded him to pursue musical goals instead.[3] For the next several years, Long toured as an opening act for other artists, including Eddie Rabbitt. Rabbitt's manager persuaded Long to move to Nashville, Tennessee; he did so in 1993, after graduating from Middle Tennessee State University.[4]
Three years later, he was signed to a songwriting contract at the publishing division of Reba McEntire's Starstruck Entertainment Company.[3][4] While in internship, Long was roommates with Darryl Worley, who later achieved success as a singer-songwriter himself.[4] Long has had his songs recorded by George Strait, Garth Brooks, Chris Young, Randy Houser, Jon Pardi, Cody Johnson, Hank Williams Jr, Reba McEntire, Casey James and Chris Stapleton.[4] Additionally, Long sang harmony vocals on Gary Allan's 1999 album "Smoke Rings in the Dark".
In 2005, Long was signed to Columbia Records.[3] His debut single, "It's Only Monday", was released but did not chart. "Anywhere but Here", his second single, peaked at No. 51 on Hot Country Songs. Long also issued a third single, entitled "Meat and Potato Man".
Long performed at the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2006.[5] He also co-wrote Casey James' "Let's Don't Call It a Night", Allan's 2009 single "Today" and Jon Pardi's "What I Can't Put Down".
