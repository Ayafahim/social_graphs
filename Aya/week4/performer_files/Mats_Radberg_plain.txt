Redirect to:Mats Rådberg
To the same page name with diacritics: This is a redirect from a page name that does not have diacritical marks (accents, umlauts, etc.) to essentially the same page name with diacritical marks or a "List of..." page anchored to a promising list item name with diacritics. The correct form is given by the target of the redirect.
This redirect aids in searches and may be applied (without piping) when the subject page concerns language translation or foreign language equivalents.  Other pages that use this redirect should be updated with a direct link to the redirect target (again, without piping).
This rcat template must not be used to tag redirects to a title with differences that are 1: ligatures (like æ and Œ – use {{R to ligature}} instead), or 2: other non-ASCII characters that do not include diacritics (like Greek letters – use {{R from ASCII-only}} instead).
This rcat template can also be used on redirects to sections and anchors to indicate the diacritics-free version of a term/name written both ways.
