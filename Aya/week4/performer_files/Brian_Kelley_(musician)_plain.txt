Redirect to:Brian KelleyThis page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect:

From a page move: This is a redirect from a page that has been moved (renamed). This page was kept as a redirect to avoid breaking links, both internal and external, that may have been made to the old page name.


From currently unnecessary disambiguation: This is a redirect from a page name that has a currently unneeded disambiguation qualifier. Examples are:
Jupiter (planet)Jupiter (unnecessary parenthetical qualifier)
Paris, FranceParis (unnecessary comma-separated qualifier)
Japanese Bobtail catJapanese Bobtail (unnecessary natural qualifier)
Category:Redirects to disambiguation pages is a subcategory of this rcat's category. So this rcat should not be used on mainspace disambiguation redirects with "(disambiguation)" in the page title. Use {{R to disambiguation page}} instead.


From an unprintworthy page title: This is a redirect from a title that would not be helpful in a printed or CD/DVD version of Wikipedia. See Wikipedia:Printability and Version 1.0 Editorial Team for more information.

When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
