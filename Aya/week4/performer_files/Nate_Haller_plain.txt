Nate Haller is a Canadian country singer and songwriter. He released his debut album Party in the Back on Starseed Records in 2022.[1] The album includes the singles "Lightning in a Bottle", "Somewhere to Drink", "Ain't Like Me", "Budweiser", and "Take My Name".[2][3]


Early life[edit]
Haller grew up on a farmhouse in Waterloo, Ontario with both of his siblings taking an interest in music, but he stated that he initially only played his brother's guitar on occasion.[4] He then was inspired to pursue music himself after seeing Australian singer-songwriter Xavier Rudd perform live while he was in high school. Soon after this, he was encouraged by a teacher in Grade 11 to enter a talent show, and began writing songs afterwards.[4]

Career[edit]
Haller began his music career playing in Kira Isabella's live band for seven years.[5] After befriending Callum Maudsley, a guitar player in the live band for the Reklaws, Haller moved in with Maudsley and the Reklaws' Stuart Walker.[6] He subsequently started touring for three years as the acoustic guitar player for the Reklaws, and credits them for showing him "how the industry works".[6] Haller began fully pursuing his solo career after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and signed with Starseed Entertainment in 2021.[4]
Haller released his debut single "Lightning in a Bottle" in March 2021,[7] and it subsequently became his first top ten on the Billboard Canada Country chart.[8] He followed it up with the promotional single "Grew Up On" in June 2021,[9] and his second radio single "Somewhere to Drink" in September 2022, which features Brett Kissel and the Reklaws.[10][11] Haller was semi-finalist in the Sirius XM "Top of the Country" contest in 2021.[4] In January 2022, Haller released the promotional single "Broken",[7] and then followed it up with his third radio single "Ain't Like Me" in May 2022.[12] He won "Rising Star" at the 2022 Country Music Association of Ontario Awards,[13] and received a nomination in the same category at the 2022 CCMA Awards.[14] In 2023, Haller released "Take My Name" to radio.[15] He also received a nomination for "Breakthrough Artist or Group of the Year" at the CCMA Awards.[16]
