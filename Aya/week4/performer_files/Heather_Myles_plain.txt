Heather Myles (born July 31, 1962) is an American country music singer, with a honky tonk Bakersfield sound.


Early life[edit]
Myles was born in Riverside, California, United States, where her parents bred and trained horses for racing.  Heather had a job in the family business until the lure of the honky-tonks called her away.
While still in her teens, she joined a band, and within a year they had a contract with HighTone.[2]

Career[edit]
Myles has released five studio albums, including two on HighTone, two on Rounder, and one on the Me and My Americana Roots label.
Her 1992 debut album Just Like Old Times contained mostly original compositions, along with songs from Jim Lauderdale and Robert Cray, and was followed by Untamed in 1995.
Her third studio album Highways and Honkytonks was released in 1998, and featured a duet with Merle Haggard on "No One is Gonna Love You Better."[3]
2002's Sweet Talk & Good Lies included a duet with Dwight Yoakam on the song "Little Chapel."[4]
Released in 2009, In The Wind was co-produced by Taras Prodaniuk (Dwight Yoakam, Lucinda Williams) who also played bass. They were accompanied by Larry Mitchell and Jim Christie (drums), and Bob Gothar (guitar).[5]
