Shortly after the birth of Kasey in 1976, Chambers moved his family to central Australia's Nullarbor Plain and earned a living by hunting and trapping rabbits and foxes that raided Nullarbor poultry farms, then selling the pelts. Bill home schooled Nash and Kasey, and taught them American folk and country music by the Carter Family, Jimmie Rogers, Hank Williams, Townes Van Zandt and Gram Parsons, as well as Australian country artists Slim Dusty, Buddy Williams and Tex Morton.
