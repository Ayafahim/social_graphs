Kim Hill (born December 30, 1963) is a contemporary Christian music singer. Aside from her career as a Grammy Award-nominated and GMA Dove Award-winning solo artist, she has also sung background vocals on projects by other artists, such as Rich Mullins (Winds of Heaven, Stuff of Earth).


Personal life[edit]
Hill was born in Starkville, Mississippi,[1] and raised in Meridian, Mississippi.[2] She attended Mississippi State,[1] where she participated in volleyball and track and field.[3] She moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where she signed her first record deal with Reunion Records.[4] Hill was married to former Auburn University football player Rob Shuler. The marriage ended in divorce,[5][3] but not before producing two sons: 3for3 band member Benji Shuler and former Stanford Cardinal football player Graham Shuler.[6][7]
As of 2021, Hill is co-owner (with Paulette Wooten) of The Treehouse, a women's retreat property in North Carolina.[8] She and Wooten formed the musical duo Wooten Hill and produced the EP Is It Alright in 2020.[9]
