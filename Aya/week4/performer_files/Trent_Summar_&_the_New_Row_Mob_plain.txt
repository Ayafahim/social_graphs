Biography[edit]
Trent Summar & The New Row Mob was founded in 2000.[2] The band's original lineup consisted of Trent Summar (lead vocals), Kenny Vaughan (guitar), Philip Wallace (guitar), Jared Reynolds (bass guitar, vocals), Dave Kennedy (drums), and Jerry Dale McFadden (piano).[3][2] Both Summar and Wallace had formerly been in a sextet called Hank Flamingo, which recorded an album for Giant Records in 1994, and Vaughn had previously been a member of McBride & the Ride. Trent Summar's unique voice merges elements of traditional country with rock & roll, honky tonk, and contemporary country music.[4]   
Under the original lineup, Trent Summar & The New Row Mob released its self-titled debut album on VFR Records in 2000. This album contained their debut single "It Never Rains in Southern California", a cover of Albert Hammond's hit single from 1972. An independently released live album was issued three years later, followed by Horseshoes & Hand Grenades in 2006.[1]
In addition to his contributions as a member of The New Row Mob, frontman Trent Summar has composed songs for other country music artists, including album tracks by Billy Currington and Gary Allan, as well as "Love You", a 2006 single for Jack Ingram,[1] and "There's the Sun", a 2013 single for Kix Brooks. He also co-wrote David Nail's "Kiss You Tonight" (2014).
