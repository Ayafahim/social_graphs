Sugarland is an American country music duo founded in Atlanta, Georgia. The duo consists of singer-songwriters Jennifer Nettles (lead vocals) and Kristian Bush (vocals, guitar, mandolin). They were founded in 2002, at which point Kristen Hall (vocals, guitar) was also a member. All three had experience in folk rock: Nettles had recorded in the groups Soul Miner's Daughter and Jennifer Nettles Band, Bush had recorded two albums as one-half of the duo Billy Pilgrim, and Hall had recorded two solo albums. After Hall left in 2006, Nettles and Bush continued as a duo.
Signed to Mercury Nashville Records in 2004, Sugarland recorded four studio albums, one Christmas album, and one live album for that label between then and 2010. These albums accounted for fifteen singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including the number-one singles "Want To", "Settlin'", "All I Want to Do", "Already Gone", and "It Happens". Nettles was also a featured vocalist on rock band Bon Jovi's late 2005-early 2006 single "Who Says You Can't Go Home", which also topped the country music charts. Their four studio albums for this label — Twice the Speed of Life, Enjoy the Ride, Love on the Inside, and The Incredible Machine — are all certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The duo went on hiatus in 2012, during which time both Nettles and Bush recorded solo albums. They reunited officially in 2017 for Bigger, a studio album issued on Big Machine Records.


Career[edit]
2004–2005: Twice the Speed of Life[edit]
Nettles, Bush, and Hall were regulars in Atlanta's folk-rock scene in the 1990s and early 2000s before Sugarland was formed, playing frequently at Eddie's Attic in Decatur, Georgia, which Nettles' ex-husband owned for a time.
Sugarland's debut album, Twice the Speed of Life, was released October 26, 2004. Serving as its lead-off single was the song "Baby Girl," which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts and set a record for the longest chart run since the inception of Nielsen SoundScan in 1990; it was also the highest-peaking debut single for a group in 13 years. Also released from the album were the singles "Something More", "Just Might (Make Me Believe)," and "Down in Mississippi (Up to No Good)," which peaked on the country charts at No. 2, No. 7, and No. 17, respectively. The album received Multi-Platinum certification for sales of three million copies, becoming their first album to achieve that status. In late 2005, the trio performed with Bon Jovi on Country Music Television's musical fusion show, Crossroads. Nettles sang with Bon Jovi on their single "Who Says You Can't Go Home." The song later went on to become a No. 1 hit on the country charts. They toured the U.S. and Canada performing with Brad Paisley in 2005 and with Kenny Chesney on his Flip Flop Summer Tour in 2006–2007.[1]

2006–2007: Enjoy the Ride[edit]

Kristen Hall left the group in December 2005. According to a statement released on January 17, 2006, by Nettles and Bush, Hall left the group to "stay home and write songs."
Sugarland was nominated for the Best New Artist Grammy[2] and performed the song "Something More" at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2006.[3] They also performed at the 2006 CMT Music Awards, where they received multiple nominations including Group/Duo Video of the Year for Just Might (Make Me Believe), Breakthrough Video of the Year for Something More, and Collaborative Video of the Year for Who Says You Can't Go Home.[4] On November 7, 2006, the duo released their second album Enjoy the Ride. It sold 211,000 during its first week and opened at No. 4 on the US Top 200 and No. 2 on the Top Country Albums charts. It went on to become their second album to achieve multi-platinum status for selling three million copies. The first two singles from this album—"Want To" and "Settlin'"—both reached Number One on the country music charts, while "Everyday America" and "Stay" were both Top Ten hits.[5] A limited-edition version of the CD, sold exclusively at Wal-Mart, was released in late 2007 and included a 5-song Christmas EP. The EP contained one original song—"Little Wood Guitar"— written by Bush and Ellis Paul.  USA Today included the song in a list of new Christmas songs released in 2007 "that might have some staying power."[6]
In 2007, Sugarland performed at multiple award ceremonies, including the 2007 CMT Music Awards[7] and the 2007 ACM awards.[8] They performed a cover of Beyoncé Knowles' "Irreplaceable" at the American Music Awards. Knowles joined Sugarland on stage starting with the second verse. The performance drew some poor reviews with The Village Voice calling it "a well-intentioned mess,"[9] although other critics also noted that the crowd enjoyed the performance.[10]
They appeared on The Tonight Show, and late in the year, they headlined their first concert tour: the Change for Change Tour along with opening acts Little Big Town and Jake Owen. At the 41st CMA Awards, the group won the award for Vocal Duo of the Year.[11]
Sugarland also appeared on a Sesame Street episode that first aired during Season 38 on September 14, 2007. During the segment, they performed "Songs" with Elmo. On November 26, 2007, they made a guest appearance in the "Car" episode of "Yo Gabba Gabba!."[12]

In February 2007, Nettles and Bush began recording Love on the Inside as a follow-up to Enjoy the Ride. The Deluxe Fan Edition was released on July 22, 2008, with the regular edition released one week later. The fan edition includes the duo's collaboration with Little Big Town and Jake Owen, a cover of The Dream Academy's 1985 hit "Life in a Northern Town." It also introduces four other bonus tracks, including "Fall Into Me," "Operation: Working Vacation," "Wishing," and a cover of Matt Nathanson's "Come On Get Higher."[13]
The lead-off single was "All I Want to Do" (completely different from the Sheryl Crow song of the same title) which debuted at No. 27 on the country charts, the highest debut for the duo. In August 2008 the song became their third No. 1 single. The following single, "Already Gone," released on September 8, 2008, became their fourth No. 1 in January 2009.

The third single from Love on the Inside, and 11th single overall, "It Happens," was released in February 2009 and became their fifth No. 1 in May 2009. The album's fourth single, "Joey" is a warning about drunk driving, encouraging those sober to "take the keys," and thematically is heavily influenced by Concrete Blonde's 1990 single of the same name. It peaked at No. 17 on the US country charts.
On May 19, 2009, Sugarland received five CMT Award nominations including a nomination for Video of the Year.[20] They were presented the award for Video Duo of the Year at the award show that broadcast on June 16, 2009.[21] During the awards show, they also performed "Love Shack" with a surprise appearance by the B-52's.[22]

Main article: Indiana State Fair stage collapse
On August 13, 2011, an outdoor stage collapsed due to high winds at the duo's concert at the Indiana State Fair for their Incredible Machine Tour, killing seven people and injuring more than 45. Moments after the crash, Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush posted on their Twitter account: "We are all right. We are praying for our fans, and the people of Indianapolis. We hope you'll join us. They need your strength." Sugarland subsequently canceled their concert scheduled for the following day, August 14, 2011, at the Iowa State Fair.[46] The band also posted a letter on their website explaining their resulting emotional experiences from the stage collapse, as well as a tribute for the families.  Two months later, on October 28, 2011, Sugarland held a free benefit concert in honor of the victims of the stage collapse.[47] One month later, on November 23, it was announced that forty-four lawsuits had been brought against Sugarland and a handful of organizations involved with the show, citing an unspecified damage amount for compensation.

Hall lawsuit[edit]
Kristen Hall left the band unexpectedly in December 2005. According to both Bush and Nettles, Hall's reason for her departure was to "stay home and write songs" and they both supported the decision.[71] In July 2008, less than three years after Hall left Sugarland, she filed a lawsuit[72] for $14 million[73] against Bush and Nettles stating that she was being excluded from sharing profits as had been agreed upon after her departure.[72]  Hall claims to have coined the name of the band and allowed Bush and Nettles "to obtain equal co-ownership of the trademark and service mark"; Hall's name is listed on the trademark for "Sugarland".[74] Both Nettles and Bush had countered Hall by stating that no profit-sharing agreement had been made with the duo before Hall's departure. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court in November 2010, although the details regarding the settlement agreement were not disclosed; both parties were given until December 13, 2010, to complete the agreement.[73]
