Biography[edit]
Harvey got his start musically learning country classics on the guitar as a small boy. His first gig came at the age of ten, and by his school years he was performing rock covers at a club when he was discovered and went off on tour as support for Tania Kernaghan.[2] In 1998 Harvey won his first Country Music (CMAA) Award for 'Vocal Collaboration of the Year' with Tanya Self for "Drive Away".[3] In 2001 he won another CMAA Award for 'Vocal Collaboration of the Year' this time with Beccy Cole, Darren Coggan and Felicity, for "Do I Ever Cross Your Mind".[4]
In 2002, Harvey won two CMAA Awards; 'Album of the Year' and 'Male Vocalist of the Year' for Workin' Overtime.[4] Workin' Overtime was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Country Album at the 2002 ARIA Awards.[5]
In 2004, Harvey won a second CMAA Award for 'Male Vocalist of the Year' that year.[4] In 2005 he received his third ARIA award nomination for Best Country Album Can't Settle for Less.[5] In 2008, he won Album of the Year I'm Doin' Alright.[4]
In 2009, he sang the Australian national anthem before the Australia vs New Zealand rugby league test match.[citation needed]
Harvey has been nominated for a CMAA Award in 2010 for Collaboration of the Year with John Williamson for "King of the Road".[6]
