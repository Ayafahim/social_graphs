John Morgan (born August 8, 1995)[1] is an American country music singer-songwriter from Sylva, North Carolina signed to BBR Music Group.[2]


Background[edit]
John Morgan was born in Sylva, North Carolina, a town in the Great Smoky Mountains, and got his start touring the summer festival circuit in a family bluegrass band for 10 years before turning to songwriting and making the move to Nashville.[2][3] A songwriting session with Kurt Allison and Tully Kennedy, two of Jason Aldean's band members, led to Morgan landing eight cuts on Aldean's Macon, Georgia, including all three of its hit singles, "If I Didn't Love You", "Trouble with a Heartbreak", and "That's What Tequila Does".[2][4] Aldean signed Morgan to his Night Train imprint under BBR Music Group.[2]
Morgan competed in American Song Contest (2022), representing his home state of North Carolina, performing "Right in the Middle".[5]
"Friends Like That" was released as Morgan's debut single to country radio on April 22, 2024. Originally a solo cut, it was redone to feature Aldean for the radio release.[4]
