Biography[edit]
Russell Edward Dickerson was born May 7, 1987, in Union City, Tennessee.[2]
He earned a bachelor's degree in music from Belmont University and signed with Creative Artists Agency in 2010.[2] In 2011, he released an extended play, Die to Live Again, and opened for David Nail.[3] He toured with Canaan Smith in 2015,[4] and Thomas Rhett in the summer of 2016. Dickerson also joined Billy Currington on the road in 2016.[5]
In 2015, he released the single "Yours" written by Dickerson, Parker Welling, and Casey Brown.[5] It became the title track to his second extended play, released on January 18, 2016, by Dent Records.[6] The EP debuted at number 14 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart,[7] selling 2,700 copies in its first week of release.[8] It launched at number 2 in the iTunes Country Store and number 8 in all genres.[9] On October 10, 2016, he signed with Triple Tigers Records which assumed distribution of the single.[10]
In its 39th week on Billboard's Country Airplay chart, Dickerson jumped from number 3 to 1 on the list on January 27, 2018.[11]
The album, Yours was released on October 13, 2017, and premiered at No. 1 on Billboard's Heat Seeker chart. The album peaked at No. 5 on Top Country Albums dated November 4, 2017, with 12,000 equivalent album units in its first week, and includes five songs co-written by Dickerson, containing an acoustic wedding version of the title track "Yours."[12] Due to the popularity of his hit single, he landed on the iTunes Best of 2015 year-end list, TheKnot.com's "Best Wedding Songs of 2016," and Spotify's #SpotifySpotlight 2016; where he later became one of Spotify's RISE artists.[13] Dickerson made his Grand Ole Opry debut on June 3, 2016.[14] An album also titled Yours produced two additional singles in "Blue Tacoma" and "Every Little Thing", which topped the Country Airplay charts as well.[15]
Dickerson's second album, Southern Symphony, came out in late 2020 on Triple Tigers. Its lead single, "Love You Like I Used To", also went to number one on the country music charts.[15] Dickerson and Tyler Hubbard were both featured on Thomas Rhett's 2022 song "Death Row".[16]
On June 27, 2023, Dickerson released his third EP Three Months Two Streets Down.[17]

Personal life[edit]
Dickerson married his wife, Kailey, on May 5, 2013. On September 10, 2020, the couple's first child was born.[18] On October 1, 2023, their second son was born.[19]
