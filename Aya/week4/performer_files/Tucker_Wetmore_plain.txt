Tucker Wetmore (born November 5, 1999)[1] is an American country music singer and songwriter.[2]


Early life and education[edit]
Wetmore was raised in Kalama, Washington and graduated from Kalama High School in 2018.[3] At age 11, he taught himself how to play piano. This was inspired by a love for Jerry Lee Lewis. [4] He played football at Montana Technological University, where he majored in business and information technology.[5]

Career[edit]
After an injury ended his football career, Wetmore turned to music and relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 2020. He released a string of promotional singles in 2021: "Kiss My A$$", "Another Shot", and "She's Trouble".[6]
In 2023, Wetmore signed with Back Blocks Music,[2] and then later signed an additional partnership with UMG Nashville.[7] "Wine Into Whiskey" became his first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts in 2024.[8] "Wind Up Missin' You" was digitally released on March 29, 2024, and was released as Wetmore's country radio debut single on June 10, 2024.[9]
