Dallas Wayne (born 1956)[1] is a singer, songwriter, voice-over artist and on-air radio personality for SiriusXM Satellite Radio.[2] A native of Springfield, Missouri, he grew up in Branson, Missouri and Cape Girardeau, Missouri.[1] Dallas began performing professionally while in high school.
He moved to Nashville, in 1975[1] where he further developed his vocal style singing demos for many of the top publishing houses in the music industry.  His roommate in Nashville was Dennis Morgan (songwriter).[1]
While touring Europe in the early 90s, Dallas forged a deal with Texicalli Records in Finland and was signed to record an album. He went on to record six albums. Later, he moved to Scandinavia, where he became a staff writer for Warner/Chappell Music.[3]
After four years living and touring in Europe, Dallas returned to the U.S. and signed a record deal with HighTone Records. In addition to recording two albums of his own on the HighTone label, Dallas was a part of the honky-tonk supergroup the TwangBangers.[4]
Dallas moved to Austin in 2003; two years later, he released the CD I'm Your Biggest Fan on the Koch Records Nashville label. In 2009, Dallas released the album I'll Take the Fifth on Smith Entertainment records. Dallas also performed with the legendary country band Heybale from 2011 to 2020 every Sunday night at The Continental Club in Austin.[5]
In 2016 and 2018, respectively, Dallas recorded the albums Songs the Jukebox Taught Me and Songs the Jukebox Taught Me Volume 2 which were released on the Heart of Texas Records' label. With these albums, Dallas pays tribute to his classic country music heroes and teachers in a fresh collection of standards featuring some well-known special guests, including Willie Nelson and Jeannie Seely.[6]
In addition, Jeannie Seely and Willie Nelson recorded a song that Dallas wrote called "Not a Dry Eye in the House", which was released as a radio single on Curb Records in 2021.[7]
Dallas' most recent album is "Coldwater, Tennessee" - an all-original project released in April 2022 by BFD/Audium Nashville and distributed exclusively through The Orchard.[8]
