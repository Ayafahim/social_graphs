Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Dasha was born and raised in San Luis Obispo, California,[2] and is of Czech descent. When she was 5 years old, she started participating in musical theater productions. She danced ballet and hip hop. She won national poetry competitions in school and then learned to play the guitar and piano at age 8. Her dad was her first talent manager and booked gigs for her in coffee shops and wineries at age 10. Her brother, who is a guitarist for Beauty School Dropout, helped produce her music. She released her first song when she was 13 years old after her father gave her a small recording budget.[2][3]
