Blake & Brian was an American country music duo composed of singer-songwriters Brian Gowan (born January 7, 1969, in Temple, Texas) and Blake Weldon (September 13, 1966, in Lufkin, Texas).[1]
The two were paired up by record producer Chuck Howard in 1995.[2][3] Their self-titled debut album was issued in 1997 on the Curb Records label. The album's lead-off single, "Another Perfect Day", peaked at No. 45 on the Billboard country charts. Country Standard Time gave the album a mixed review, stating that although Gowan and Weldon were "indistinguishable vocally and equally malleable", and although some of the songs were derivative of the Eagles, the more up-tempo tracks were "punch[ed] up... with timeless Texas kick".[2] After releasing this album, they charted two more singles ("The Wish" and "Amnesia"), the latter of which was not included on an album. By 1999, Blake & Brian had parted ways. Gowan released a solo album entitled Warm Spanish Wine in 2000.[3] He also co-wrote Rodney Atkins' 1997 debut single "In a Heartbeat" and three songs on Atkins' 2003 debut album Honesty.
