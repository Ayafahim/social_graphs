American singer-songwriter
Steve Richard, (born 1972 in Providence, Rhode Island, living in St. Louis, Missouri) is an American Christian Country music singer.
He is on the Force MP Entertainment record label.
His Goodwill Radio Tour raised funds for local and national charities, including Toys For
Tots, the National Cancer Society and the Salvation Army.
Richard released album "Steve Richard" in 2008 and "Up to Somethin'" in 2009, produced by Phil O'Donnell and recorded at Reba McEntire's Starstruck Studios and at Nashville's Legends Studio.
For the first album Richard moved to Nashville, TN and worked with producer/musician John Rich, producer Michael Bradford (Kid Rock, and Uncle Kracker) with whom he wrote seven of the songs. The single "Stomp" was used for a line dance[1] and became an

As of 2012[update] Richard lived in St. Louis, Missouri, with his wife, Rachelle and daughter Marion (born 2007).
