Zach Top (born September 26, 1997) is an American country music singer-songwriter from Sunnyside, Washington signed to Leo33.[2]


Background[edit]
Zach Top was born on September 26, 1997,[3] and grew up on a ranch in Sunnyside, Washington. He got his musical start performing as part of a bluegrass band with his siblings called Top String.[4] After performing as part of various bluegrass groups throughout his teens and early twenties, Top relocated to Nashville in 2021, where he first signed a publishing deal with Major Bob Music.[4] He began recording as a solo artist in 2019, releasing a string of bluegrass singles that culminated in the release of his self-titled debut EP with RBR Entertainment on May 13, 2022.[5]
He pivoted to recording country music and in September 2023, it was announced that Top was signed as the flagship artist for the newly-formed independent record label Leo33.[2] His debut single to country radio, "Sounds Like the Radio", was released on January 8, 2024, and was the most-added song at the format with 55 stations adding the song upon impact.[6] It has since charted in the top 30 of the Billboard Country Airplay chart. Top co-wrote "Sounds Like the Radio" with Carson Chamberlain and Wyatt McCubbin, inspired by his love of 1990s-era country music and artists such as George Strait, Keith Whitley, and Randy Travis.[3][7] It served as the lead single to Top's debut studio album, Cold Beer & Country Music, which was released on April 5, 2024.[8]
