Jaydee Bixby (born August 14, 1990) is a Canadian country musician who was the runner-up on the fifth season of Canadian Idol.  In 2008 he signed with Her Royal Majesty's Records and went on to release his debut album Cowboys and Cadillacs. Moving on to On Ramp Records in 2010, he released his second album Easy to Love.


Before Canadian Idol[edit]
Bixby was born in Drumheller, Alberta, where he grew up. He moved to Red Deer, Alberta where he attended Hunting Hills High School. He was in a band called the "Bixbys" with his mother, father, and a family friend; they played at bars, weddings and rodeos. Jaydee has five sisters, four older and one younger. His father taught him guitar.[1]

Canadian Idol[edit]
Bixby auditioned for Canadian Idol in Calgary, Alberta. He sang "Lawdy Miss Clawdy" in his audition, and prompted judge Zack Werner to ask him what decade it was in Red Deer.[2] All four judges agreed that Bixby should go on to the Toronto round. During his first solo in the Toronto rounds, he prompted Werner to tell everyone that he was the competition. During the semi-final rounds of the show, the judges predicted him as a potential winner. He made the top 10, and gained the support of votefortheworst.com. He did well week one of the top 10, but after that failed to really impress the judges, until the top 5-week. Although Bixby never fell into the bottom 3, he was runner-up to Brian Melo on September 11, 2007.
