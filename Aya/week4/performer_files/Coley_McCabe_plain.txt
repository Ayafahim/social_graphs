Biography[edit]
Born in McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania and raised in Hedgesville, West Virginia,[3] McCabe frequently sang at the Jamboree USA Music Hall in Wheeling, West Virginia as a youth. According to The Tennessean newspaper, while still in junior college, "her sister and father were killed in separate car accidents, and her mother died of a pulmonary embolism, leaving her to take care of her younger sister," who later went on to attend college. By 1995, McCabe was a resident of Nashville, Tennessee, where she worked for an airline company. One of her earliest songwriting contracts was signed in 1997.[4]
Subsequently mployed by a publishing company in Nashville, McCabe was signed by RCA Records in 2000, and has released several singles, including "Grow Young with You," which was used for the film soundtrack of Where the Heart Is. She and country music singer and composer Thom Shepherd were married in Las Vegas in 2015.[5][6][7]
