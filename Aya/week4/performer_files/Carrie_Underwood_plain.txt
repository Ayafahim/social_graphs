Her debut album, Some Hearts (2005), was bolstered by the successful crossover singles "Jesus, Take the Wheel" and "Before He Cheats", becoming the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history. She won three Grammy Awards for the album, including Best New Artist. The next studio album, Carnival Ride (2007) had one of the biggest opening weeks of all time by a female artist and won two Grammy Awards.

She achieved the second best-selling release by a woman in 2012 and won a Grammy Award with her fourth album, Blown Away (2012). Her compilation Greatest Hits: Decade #1 (2014) spawned the crossover single "Something in the Water". Her fifth studio album, Storyteller (2015), made her the only country artist to have all first five studio albums reach either numbers one or two on the Billboard 200 chart. With her sixth album, Cry Pretty (2018), she became the only woman to top the Billboard 200 with four country albums and had the biggest week for any album by a woman in 2018. She released her first Christmas project, My Gift, in 2020, and first gospel collection, My Savior, in 2021. Her 2022 studio album, Denim & Rhinestones, marked a return to her country pop sound.

Early life[edit]
Carrie Marie Underwood was born on March 10, 1983,[2][3] in Muskogee, Oklahoma, to Carole (née Shatswell) and Steve Underwood.[4] She has two older sisters, Shanna and Stephanie,[5] and was raised on her parents' farm in the nearby rural town of Checotah.[6] Her father worked in a paper mill while her mother taught elementary school.[7] During her childhood, Underwood performed at Robbins Memorial Talent Show, and sang at her local church, First Free Will Baptist Church.[8] She later sang for local events in Checotah, including Old Settler's Day and the Lions Club.[9]
A local admirer arranged for her to go to Nashville when she was 14 to audition for Capitol Records.[10] In 1997, Capitol Records was preparing a contract for Underwood but canceled it when company management changed. Underwood said of the event, "I honestly think it's a lot better that nothing came out of it now, because I wouldn't have been ready then. Everything has a way of working out."[11]
While at Checotah High School, she was an Honor Society member, a cheerleader, and played basketball and softball.[12] Underwood graduated from Checotah High School in 2001 as salutatorian.[9] She did not initially pursue singing after graduation and once said "After high school, I pretty much gave up on the dream of singing. I had reached a point in my life where I had to be practical and prepare for my future in the 'real world'".[12]
She attended Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, graduating magna cum laude, in 2006, with a bachelor's degree in mass communication and an emphasis in journalism.[13] She spent part of one of her summers as a page for Oklahoma State Representative Bobby Frame.[14] She also waited tables at a pizzeria, worked at a zoo, and worked at a veterinary clinic.[12] Underwood is an alumna of the Alpha Iota chapter of Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority.[15]
For two summers, she performed in Northeastern State University's Downtown Country show in Tahlequah. She competed in numerous beauty pageants at the university and was selected as Miss NSU runner-up in 2004.[16]

In mid-2004, Underwood auditioned for American Idol in St. Louis, Missouri, singing Bonnie Raitt's "I Can't Make You Love Me". After she sang "Could've Been" by Tiffany on the top 12 girls night, judge Simon Cowell commented that she would be one of the favorites to win the competition.[17][18] During the top 11 finalists' performance on the March 22, 2005, Idol episode, Underwood sang a rendition of the number one 1980s rock hit "Alone", made famous by Heart, and Cowell predicted that Underwood would not only win the competition, but she would also outsell all previous Idol winners.[19] One of the show's producers later said she dominated the voting, winning every week by a large margin.[20][21] On May 25, 2005, Underwood became the season four winner. Her winnings included a recording contract worth at least a million dollars, use of a private jet for a year, and a Ford Mustang convertible.[22]

2005–2007: Some Hearts and breakthrough[edit]
Underwood's music career began with the release of her first single, "Inside Your Heaven", on June 14, 2005. The song debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, with Underwood becoming only the third artist to debut in the top slot since chart policy changed in 1998.[23] She also broke Billboard chart history as the first country music artist ever to debut at number one on the Hot 100 and the song became the first song from a country artist to go to number one on the Hot 100 since country group Lonestar's "Amazed" did so in 2000.[24] "Inside Your Heaven" is the only single by a solo country artist in the decade of 2000–2009 to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[25] It also debuted at number one on the Billboard Pop 100 and on the Canadian Singles Chart, topping it for seven consecutive weeks, becoming the longest-running number one single of 2005 in Canada. It sold nearly one million copies and was certified gold by the RIAA and double platinum by the CRIA.[26][27]

Artistry[edit]
Voice[edit]
Underwood has been highly acclaimed for her vocals. David Wild of Rolling Stone has praised her voice, saying that "she can hit any note".[393] Her vocal range has been described as "enormous", with critics highlighting her ability to hold notes for an extended period of time. Billboard describes her vocal ability as "freakish".[394] Concert critics have pointed out that "she'll let loose with an improbably long note that runs through more octaves than you knew existed".[395] When asked if it ever becomes difficult to belt at such high intensity during her 90–120 minute live shows, Underwood responded, "I'm too proud to drop keys. I won't do it. Maybe the older I get, I'll write some songs in lower keys so it'll be easier. I've always been pretty good as far as stamina onstage. Being able to work out and stay physically strong is important ... So far, it's worked for me. I'm just blessed at being able to be loud for long periods of time."[396] Fellow country music singer Randy Travis paid high praises to Underwood's voice when asked about her cover of his 1988 hit song "I Told You So", saying that "her voice is so much better suited to the song. I have a baritone voice, and her soprano voice really fits well with the range of the song. Her ability to get into the upper register of her voice and just hold those high notes is great."[397]  Her voice has also been praised as "versatile".[398] She has performed live versions of gospel songs like "How Great Thou Art", in which Yahoo! critics noticed her ability to move an audience with a "powerful performance",[126] and rock songs like Guns N' Roses' "Paradise City", with Rolling Stone critics saying it was a "standout performance", adding that "when the song reached its crescendo, the singer went right over the edge with it, twirling like a tornado and tossing in more than a few banshee wails" and even saying "if the original members of Guns N' Roses ever wanted to reunite without Axl Rose, they might be wise to ask Carrie Underwood to fill his bandana".[399] In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Underwood at number 158 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[400]

Influences[edit]
Underwood has credited "music as a whole" as her major influence, since she "grew up listening to music" and "there were songs, different kind of songs coming at me from everywhere".[401] She has mentioned rock acts like Queen, Guns N' Roses, George Michael, the Rolling Stones, and My Chemical Romance as influences.[402][403] In a 2014 interview Underwood spoke on the late Queen frontman, "I've always been a huge fan and lover of Freddie Mercury. I would listen to him when I was a kid. He could do so many amazing things with his voice. People like that — who had incredible voices — I was always drawn to."[403] In July 2022 she joined Guns N' Roses on stage during their concert at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London where she performed with another of her idols, band frontman Axl Rose, saying after, "I've covered enough Guns N' Roses stuff, and it was people like him who taught me how to sing".[403]
Among country artists, she has listed George Strait,[404] Dolly Parton,[405] Randy Travis,[406] Martina McBride, Reba McEntire, and Garth Brooks as influences.[407] Although never publicly mentioning Faith Hill and Shania Twain as musical influences, critics have linked Underwood's musical style to those of Hill and Twain.[408] Her music is generally country pop with a rock influence similar to that of Kelly Clarkson, as noticed by Rolling Stone.[409] She has also released songs with Christian music influence.[410][411]

Legacy[edit]
Since her debut in 2005, Underwood has been praised by both veteran artists and music critics. In 2014, Rolling Stone described Underwood as "the female vocalist of her generation of any genre",[412] while a 2012 issue of Billboard magazine referred to her as Country Music's reigning Queen.[413]
Time featured her in its 2014 list of the 100 most influential people in the world, in which Brad Paisley wrote "not only has she earned her place, she's also raised the bar: she's a prolific songwriter, a trendsetter and an Opry member"; Paisley further called her "the best singer in any format of music."[210][414] In 2015, Grady Smith of The Guardian praised her, saying "Carrie Underwood has emerged as the leader of country music".[415] Vince Gill has also stated: "The possibility of Carrie's longevity is through the roof. There are fine singers, and there are gifted, great singers, and she's one of those. Her vocal skills are off the hook".[414] She has further received public commendation from Stevie Nicks,[416] Melissa Etheridge,[393] Steven Tyler,[417] Tony Bennett,[418] Dolly Parton,[405][419][420] and Loretta Lynn.[421] David Wild of Rolling Stone has stated that "Carrie Underwood is the greatest thing that American Idol ever gave us".[393] She was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 2017,[422] and the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2018, for her achievements in music.[423]
Underwood has influenced pop girl group Fifth Harmony,[424] singer Mollie King of British pop girl group The Saturdays,[425] singer Kelsea Ballerini,[426][427] The Voice winner Danielle Bradbery,[428] American Idol runner-up Lauren Alaina,[429] and singer and actress Lucy Hale.[430]

With the singles from her second album, Carnival Ride, she became the first female country artist since Shania Twain in 1995 to pull four number-one's from one album.[74] In 2010, with the singles of her third album, Play On, she achieved ten career number-one singles on the Hot Country Songs, an achievement for which she was named by the Guinness Book of World Records as the female country artist with the most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart (since accurate sales records were introduced in the US in 1991), tied with Reba McEntire.[221] With such a feat, she became the only female artist in country music history to have eleven consecutive top two singles; at that time, she had twelve official country singles: ten number-ones.

She told the British newspaper The Independent, "As a married person myself, I don't know what it's like to be told I can't marry somebody I love and want to marry", she said. "I can't imagine how that must feel. I definitely think we should all have the right to love, and love publicly, the people that we want to love." Underwood went on to say, "Our church is gay-friendly. Above all, God wanted us to love others. It's not about setting rules, or [saying] 'everyone has to be like me'. No. We're all different. That's what makes us special. We have to love each other and get on with each other. It's not up to me to judge anybody."[489]
Underwood launched the Academy of Country Music Lifting Lives Temporary Home Fund in 2010.

"To have a star like Carrie Underwood perform Maria in The Sound of Music, and in such a very special and unique production, is exciting beyond words", said Ted Chapin, president of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization. "Part of the magic of Rodgers and Hammerstein is how their work has adapted itself to so many different incarnations, and I am certain the fresh spirit Underwood brings to her own songs will transition into exciting versions of the classic songs we all know and love."[503]

Writing[edit]
Underwood released her debut book, Find Your Path, on March 3, 2020, published by Dey Street Books.[308] It became a New York Times best seller, debuting at number two on the How-To and Miscellaneous list.[504] This book contains insight into Carrie's lifestyle and aims to help people find their lifestyle.

Personal life[edit]
Marriage and children[edit]
Underwood began dating NHL player Mike Fisher after they met at one of her concerts in late 2008, and they became engaged in December 2009.[506] According to The Canadian Press, Fisher proposed in Ottawa on December 20, 2009.[507] Underwood's engagement ring features a yellow diamond and was valued at $150,000.[508] On July 10, 2010, Underwood and Fisher wed at the Ritz-Carlton Lodge in Greensboro, Georgia, with more than 250 people in attendance.[509][510] The couple's first son was born on February 27, 2015.[511] Their second son was born on January 21, 2019.[512][513][514]
Between the births of her two sons, Underwood had three miscarriages. In 2018, she told CBS News that this was the basis for her song "Cry Pretty", as "I would have these horrible things going on in my life, and then have to go smile and, like, do some interviews or, like, do a photo shoot or something".[515]
On February 11, 2011, an Ottawa radio station, 105.3 KISS-FM, stated that it would ban the playing of Underwood's music because her husband, Mike Fisher, was traded to the Nashville Predators the day before.[516] Due to Underwood's fans' threats on Facebook to never tune into the radio station, the station later apologized for its actions, saying that its statements were meant to be taken as a joke, as it does not play Underwood's country songs anyway, and it was its "tongue-in-cheek way of wishing Fisher the best of luck in Nashville."[517] Fisher later criticized the station saying "obviously Carrie had nothing to do with the move or the trade or anything so to imply something like that was just wrong", and noting that both he and Underwood were disappointed in the negativity the radio station created.[518] Underwood was selected by The Hockey News on its annual list of the 100 People of Power and Influence in Ice Hockey. For the 2012 list, Underwood ranked at number 85.[519]
In 2010, Underwood and Fisher bought a mansion on eleven acres near Ottawa in the luxurious Spruce Ridge district.

Personal interests[edit]
Underwood is a practicing Evangelical Christian,[522][523]  and a vegetarian.[524] She stopped eating meat at the age of 13 because she could not stand the thought of eating one of her own animals.

Underwood performs at Super Bowl XLIV in February 2010
In a 2007 interview with PETA, Underwood stated, "Ever since I was little I loved animals ... If you told me I could never sing again, I'd say that was horrible, but it's not my life. If you told me I could never be around animals again, I would just die."[527][528] In April 2022, Underwood shared the loss of her dog, Ace, whom she had adopted in 2007.[529] Ten months later, Underwood shared she had adopted a new dog, named Charlie, who she met backstage while touring in Charlotte, North Carolina.[530]
In April 2013, Underwood spoke out with disapproval regarding the Tennessee "Ag Gag bill".[531] The bill makes it a crime to videotape animal cruelty or abuse and then fail to turn in the evidence to authorities within 48 hours. This is to stop animal rights activists from accumulating enough documentation to prove that animal cruelty is routine in big agribusiness.[532] Underwood tweeted, "Shame on TN lawmakers for passing the Ag Gag bill. If Gov. Bill Haslam signs this, he needs to expect me at his front door. Who's with me?"[533] State Rep. Andy Holt responded to her tweet, saying, "I would say that Carrie Underwood will stick to singing, I'll stick to lawmaking."[534] Underwood later responded via Twitter, "I should stick to singing? Wow...sorry, I'm just a tax-paying citizen concerned for the safety of my family. #NoAgGag".[535] She also tweeted Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, saying "Please don't sign the Ag Gag bill. Think about the welfare of the animals as well as the consumers. I'm begging you..."[536]
Underwood has stated that she has a great interest in sports. She has participated in the annual City of Hope Celebrity Softball tournament for charity for many years. The event takes place in Nashville, Tennessee, and benefits research for life-threatening diseases.[537] In 2005, she performed the "Star-Spangled Banner" at Game 4 of the NBA Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons,[538] and in 2006 at the NBA All-Star Game.[539] She performed at halftime of the 2006 Thanksgiving Day football game at Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas, and was friends with Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo.[540] She also performed the "Star-Spangled Banner" at the NFC Championship Game between the Seattle Seahawks and Carolina Panthers in 2006,[541] as well as at the 2006 edition of NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600,[542] the MLB All Star Game in Pittsburgh, and at Game 3 of the 2007 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and Colorado Rockies.[543] On February 7, 2010, Underwood performed the National Anthem for Super Bowl XLIV.[544]
Underwood has performed the opening theme song for NBC Sunday Night Football since 2013.[545] Faith Hill, whom Underwood replaced, later expressed full support for Underwood, congratulating her via Twitter and stating that it was "an awesome choice" by NBC/SNF and that Underwood "will rock it".[546] Underwood's original song was a modification of her song "Oh, Sunday Night", but was changed to an original song, "Game On", for the 2018 NFL season.[citation needed] She sang the National Anthem for the Nashville Predators prior to their victory over the Chicago Blackhawks in Game 3 of the first round of the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs and prior to their victory over the Winnipeg Jets in Game 2 of the second round of the 2018 Stanley Cup Playoffs.[citation needed]
