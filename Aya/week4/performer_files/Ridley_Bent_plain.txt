Ridley Bent is the stage name of Brian Daniel Fowler,[2] a Canadian country singer-songwriter. Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Bent was raised throughout Canada in a military family.[3] He formally launched his musical career in 2000 in British Columbia, including performances as an opening act for Great Big Sea[4] and Sam Roberts.[5]
His debut album, Blam!, was released on MapleMusic Recordings in 2005, and was marked by a style that incorporated country, rock and hip hop influences, in a manner similar to Buck 65.[6] The album was produced by Chin Injeti, formerly of the R&B band Bass is Base. Described by Bent as "hick hop",[7] the album was best known for the single "Suicidewinder".[6]
His subsequent albums, 2007's Buckles and Boots and 2010's Rabbit on My Wheel, pursued a more conventional country sound.[8]
In early 2009, Bent's song "Nine Inch Nails" won in the 8th Annual Independent Music Awards and Vox Pop vote for Best Country Song.[9]
More recently he has toured and recorded with a new backing band, the Killer Tumbleweeds. His first album with that band, Ridley Bent and the Killer Tumbleweeds, was released in 2018.[10]
