Wyatt is a Canadian country music group from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan composed of Scott Patrick (vocals, guitar), Daniel Fortier (vocals, guitar), Bray Hudson (drums) and Cam Ewart (bass).[1] Following the release of a Christmas album, Snowed In, in 2005, Wyatt released their debut album, Hard Road, in 2007.[2] No singles were released from the project because the band "didn't feel it was quite there yet."[2]
In June 2009, Wyatt won Big Dog 92.7's The Next Big Thing talent contest. Their prize included $5,000 cash, a showcase for music industry professionals, career guidance, a trip to the Canadian Country Music Association Awards and the option of having a professional single released to radio.[2] Their single "Ride On" debuted at No. 48 on the Billboard Canadian Country Singles chart in December 2009.[2] A second single, "Questions," reached the Top 40 in May 2010.[3] Both songs are included on Wyatt's second studio album, If I Had a Dollar…, released in June 2010.[3]
