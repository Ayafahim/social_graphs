He is signed to Universal Music Group Nashville's MCA Nashville division, for which he has released the albums Home State in 2018 and Bluebird Days in 2023, as well as two extended plays. His discography also includes seven singles, of which five have reached number one on Country Airplay.


Biography and career[edit]
Jordan Carl Wheeler Davis was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, to mother Luwanna and father Ricky. He has a brother, Jacob Davis (who is also a country singer), and a sister, Jentry. His uncle, Stan Paul Davis, wrote Tracy Lawrence's hit singles "Today's Lonely Fool" and "Better Man, Better Off". He attended C. E. Byrd High School before graduating college with an Environmental Science degree from Louisiana State University.[1][2]
After graduation, he moved to Nashville in 2012,[1] and secured a recording contract with Universal Music Group Nashville in 2016.[3]
Davis's debut single, "Singles You Up", came out in mid-2017. He wrote the song with Steven Dale Jones and Justin Ebach. It hit number one on the Billboard Country Airplay chart in April 2018. The corresponding debut album, Home State, was released on March 23, 2018.[4] Paul DiGiovanni, guitarist for Boys Like Girls, produced the album.[1] "Take It from Me" was released to country radio on May 7, 2018; it was the second single from the album. It reached number two on the Country Airplay chart in March 2019. The album's third single, "Slow Dance in a Parking Lot" released to country radio on April 22, 2019, and also topped Country Airplay.[5] His hit song, "Buy Dirt," featuring country music star Luke Bryan, was the only one out of two extended songs to hit top 100 in Canada.
In May 2020, Davis announced the release of his self-titled extended play, which was produced by Paul DiGiovanni. Davis said "I can't tell y'all how pumped I am for y'all to hear these songs. I'm proud of this one." The EP was preceded by the release of "Cool Anymore", "Detours", and "Almost Maybes".[6] Davis is nominated for ACM Song of the Year and Single of the Year with "Buy Dirt" featuring Luke Bryan. They won Song of the Year.[7] Davis co-wrote the single "Broken Umbrella" by Jojo Mason.
In November 2022, Davis performed at the halftime show at the 109th Grey Cup in Regina, Saskatchewan alongside Tyler Hubbard and Josh Ross.[8]

Personal life[edit]
Davis married Kristen O'Connor in 2018.[9] Their daughter, Eloise, was born on October 17, 2019.[10] Their first son, Locklan, was born on September 4, 2021, and their second son, Elijah, was born April 15, 2023.
