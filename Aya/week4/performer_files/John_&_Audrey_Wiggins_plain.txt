In 1995, 1996, and 1997, John & Audrey Wiggins received Country Music Association nominations for Duo of the Year.[5] A second album, The Dream, followed in 1997 under the production of Dann Huff. and the only charting release from it was "Somewhere in Love" which peaked at No. 49 on the country charts.
