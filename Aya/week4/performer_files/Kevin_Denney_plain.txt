Kevin Denney (born January 27, 1978)[1] is an American country music artist. Signed to Lyric Street Records in 2001, he made his debut on the country music scene with the release of his self-titled album (2002's Kevin Denney), which produced three chart singles, including "That's Just Jessie", a Top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts. He was dropped from Lyric Street's roster in 2003, although he co-wrote a track on Tracy Byrd's 2006 Different Things album.


Biography[edit]
Denney's interest in music began at an early age. His mother and father, both of whom sang in a gospel music quartet, bought Denney his first guitar when he was three years old.[2] He also became a frequent listener of the Grand Ole Opry radio shows, and played in his cousin's bluegrass music band.[2]
At age 17, however, he briefly stopped focusing on his musical interests to re-assess his future. On his eighteenth birthday, his girlfriend took him to a George Strait concert. Seeing Strait in concert helped Denney discover that music was his passion, and he later joined a local band that was looking for a lead singer.[2] Denney later went solo, and was signed to Lyric Street Records in 2001.[3] His eponymous debut album, released in 2002, produced three charting singles on the Hot Country Songs charts: "That's Just Jessie" at number 16, "Cadillac Tears" at number 30 and "It'll Go Away" at number 43.[4] He also contributed a rendition of "White Christmas" to the label's multi-artist compilation No Wrapping Required.[5]
In late 2003, Denney charted a fourth single, "A Year at a Time," which peaked at number 44 on the country charts. The song did not appear on an album, and Denney exited the label.[4]
He co-wrote a track on Tracy Byrd's 2006 album Different Things, and Craig Morgan's 2009 single "Bonfire." He also co-wrote "Don't Ask Me About a Woman", a song recorded by Easton Corbin on his 2010 self-titled debut album.
