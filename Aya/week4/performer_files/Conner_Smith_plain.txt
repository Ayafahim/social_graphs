Biography[edit]
Conner Smith was born and raised in Nashville. Smith participated in the 2013 Little League World Series as a member of the South Nashville team that represented the Southeast Region.[1] His mother, Jennifer Vickery Smith, worked in the country music industry and often interviewed artists.  Conner Smith was inspired to start songwriting himself. He began writing songs with Nashville songwriters Ashley Gorley and Zach Crowell by the time he was 20.[2]
In late 2021, Smith released a song called "I Hate Alabama", which went viral on TikTok.[3] The song's success got him a deal with Big Machine Records' Valory label. He released an extended play for the label titled Didn't Go Too Far in 2022. The project's lead single "Learn from It" made the top 40 on Billboard Country Airplay.[2] Crowell produced the EP.[3] Smith released his second single "Take It Slow" to country radio in early 2023; it was certified Gold by the RIAA but only got to No. 52 on the charts. He released "Creek Will Rise" in 2023, and has become his first top 20 hit on the Country Airplay chart. It served as the lead single to his debut studio album, Smoky Mountains, which was released on January 26, 2024. Smith made history on March 10, 2024 when "Creek Will Rise" became the first ever number one on the UK Country Airplay chart.[4]
