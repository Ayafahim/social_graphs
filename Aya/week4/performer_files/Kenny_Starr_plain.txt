Kenneth Trebbe (born September 21, 1952),[2] known professionally as Kenny Starr, is an American country singer.[3]

Biography[edit]
Starr was born in Topeka, Kansas and grew up in Burlingame, Kansas.[3] At the age of nine, he fronted his own group, the Rockin' Rebels, and in his teens he played at local clubs leading a pop group, Kenny and the Imperials.[3] Later switching to country music, a win in a local talent contest led him to perform on a bill containing Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn.[3] Lynn encouraged his efforts and, with her support, Starr secured a recording contract with MCA Records.[3]
He recorded for MCA between 1973 and 1978, charting 13 singles,[4] and releasing one studio album. For much of the 1970s, he was a member of Loretta Lynn's touring band, the Coal Miners.[3]
Starr's biggest hit was a cover of David Geddes's single "The Blind Man in the Bleachers".[3] Starr's version was a hit single in the U.S. on the country charts in 1976, reaching No. 2 on the Country Singles chart,[4] and was a minor hit on the pop charts peaking at No. 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to No. 1 on the country chart in Canada. The album from which it was taken, also called The Blind Man in the Bleachers, reached No. 12 on the Billboard Country Albums chart.
