Tom McBride (18 September 1936 – 17 April 2018), known as Big Tom, was an Irish country, traditional and easy listening singer, as well as a guitarist, and saxophone player.
With a career spanning over six decades, he started his career in 1966 as the frontman of the Irish showband Big Tom and The Mainliners.[2]


Career[edit]
On 1 February 2008, Big Tom began a 12-date tour of Ireland[3] after doctors gave him the all clear. On 25 May, Big Tom performed for the closure night of the Galtymore dance hall in Cricklewood, London.[4] On 27 July, Big Tom was the headline act at London's Irish Festival.[5] On 23 November, Big Tom headlined the Claremorris Dance Festival weekend. In July 2009, K-MAC Records announced more dates in Ireland for Big Tom and the Mainliners which commenced in August. From 14 August to 13 September 2009, Big Tom ran a successful tour of Ireland with large attendances[clarification needed] to venues. The highlight was the Glencarn Hotel in Tom's hometown Castleblayney where the concert was packed to capacity. The tour ended in Ennis, County Clare, with fans travelling many miles to see Big Tom and the band. Two days after the end of the tour the band's trombone player and vocalist Cyril McKevitt died of a heart attack.
In 2010, Big Tom announced an extensive series of tour dates. From 2011 until his death in 2018, Big Tom and his band continued to perform with sporadic appearances.

Personal life[edit]
Big Tom lived in Oram, just outside Castleblayney.  He would often be seen at the local shop on his horse, tractor or quad.  He was very generous with his time and always participated in the Oram St Patrick's Day Parade and many of the local football events.  The wall in the Oram Community Centre has a huge mural of Big Tom.
Big Tom suffered from a fear of flying. In 1980, he undertook a sea voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to record his Blue Wings album in Nashville.[citation needed]
In 2000, Big Tom underwent a nodule operation on his throat. In November 2006, Big Tom suffered a sudden heart attack at the age of 70,[6] which had put doubt into whether he would ever tour again with his band. on 24 March 2008, Big Tom performed at Castlebar's TF Ballroom's final farewell night (in its current guise) but he was reported to have taken ill on stage[7] during the performance.
In September 2004, Big Tom was reported to have been in a list of Irish tax evaders.[8]
Big Tom was married to his wife Rose McBride until her death in January 2018.[9]
