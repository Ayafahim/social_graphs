Personal life and radio[edit]
Chris Hawkey was born a twin whose brother didn't survive their birth[1] and raised in Union City, Indiana, where he graduated from Mississinawa Valley High School. Starting in 1989 he attended a broadcasting school in Dayton, Ohio, pursuing careers in both radio and music.[2] He got a job running a control board for the syndicated Howard Stern Show[1] before getting hired in 2001 to co-host and produce the Power Trip Morning Show on KFAN Radio, a sports radio network. Hawkey produces the radio broadcast of the Minnesota Vikings[2] and is a play-by-play announcer for AMSOIL Championship Snocross on CBS Sports Network.[1]

Musical career[edit]
In 2001 Hawkey recorded his first solo project, "Minutes to Memories", which showcased his songwriting. He had a second solo project, "The Pursuit", which was a benefit partnership that raised money from record sales.

RYZ[edit]
Ryz was a rock band that performed mostly in the Los Angeles area in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Chris Hawkey was the lead singer of the band. They recorded such songs as "The Distance", "Wicked Ways", "Waiting and Watching", and "Wild Ones" 
Ryz ultimately broke up when offered the opportunity to go on tour opening for Gorky Park. Hawkey thought it was a great opportunity but other members did not want to leave their day jobs, so they went their separate directions.[citation needed]

In 2022, the band reunited and has started recording new music.
