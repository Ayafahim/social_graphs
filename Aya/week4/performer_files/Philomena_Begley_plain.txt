Philomena Begley (born 20 October 1942)[1] is a country music singer from Northern Ireland. In 1975, Begley had a hit with her version of the Billie Jo Spears' song Blanket on the Ground reaching higher sales than Spears in Ireland. In 2020, Begley became the first lady to be  inducted into ICMA Hall Of Fame. Today, Begley is affectionately known as 'The Queen of Country'.[2]


Background[edit]
Philomena Begley was born and grew up in Pomeroy, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland,[3] and worked in a hat factory in Cookstown before her break into music.[3]

Career[edit]
Her first venture as a singer was with the popular Old Cross Céilí Band, with whom she sang as a dare, but stayed with the group.[3] The group soon became known as the Old Cross Bandshow and released three records in Ireland in 1968 and 1969, but none made an impression in the chart. In September 1970, the band changed its name to The Country Flavour.[3] Begley's first record following this became her first chart hit when "Here Today, Gone Tomorrow" reached number seven in the Irish chart.[4] In 1974, she formed the Ramblin' Men,[3] while the Country Flavour continued to tour with several other lead singers (including Eileen King and Dan O'Hara) during the 1970s.
Begley regularly toured with Ray Lynam from 1975 and they recorded many duets together, probably their most popular being "My Elusive Dreams",[3] which went on to be mentioned in The Pogues' song, "A Pair of Brown Eyes".
In 1975, Begley had a hit with her version of Billie Jo Spears' hit song "Blanket on the Ground" which took her to number five in the Irish chart.[3] Spears also released the song in the United Kingdom and in Ireland at the same time, but in Ireland, Begley's version received the highest sales, as Spears' version only went to number 11.[5] Begley occasionally performed with Spears and later recorded a tribute song to her after the American star's death in 2011. 
By 1977, she was undertaking a major tour of the United States, and in 1978, she was invited to sing at the Grand Ole Opry by Porter Wagoner.[3] Since then, she has returned annually to Nashville, been a guest of honour at the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York City, and has sung at both the Grand Ole Opry and Carnegie Hall.  Although few of Begley's CDs have been released in the United States, a number are available for downloading on the site Freegal Music.

Recognition[edit]
One of Begley's biggest fans is Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell, and he once said, "When Philomena sings a song you believe her... you feel that she's experienced every emotion she expresses."[6]

Personal life[edit]
Philomena Begley is married to Tom Quinn and they have three children Mary, Aiden and Carol. She is also a grandmother. They reside on a farm in Galbally, County Tyrone. Her son Aiden Quinn has also established a singing career for himself. Her niece, Andrea Begley, won the BBC TV Series The Voice in June 2013.[7]
She is a regular contributor to the Belfast Telegraph's Lifestyle section.[citation needed]
