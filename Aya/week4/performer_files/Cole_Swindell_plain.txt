2013–2015: Cole Swindell[edit]
In 2013, Swindell's independently released debut single "Chillin' It", buoyed by heavy airplay on SiriusXM satellite radio channel "The Highway", became a hit[1] and Swindell signed a record deal with Warner Music Nashville. The demo of "Chillin' It" was sent to radio before it had been mastered.[9]
Swindell released his self-titled debut album on February 18, 2014.[10] Luke Bryan's guitarist, Michael Carter, produced the rest of the album. Along with Lee Brice, Swindell opened Bryan's 2014 That's My Kind of Night Tour.[11] "Chillin' It" became a top-five hit on Country Airplay and number 1 single on Hot Country Songs. The album's second single is "Hope You Get Lonely Tonight", which Swindell and Carter co-wrote with both members of Florida Georgia Line, Brian Kelley and Tyler Hubbard. The album's third single, "Ain't Worth the Whiskey", was released to country radio on November 3, 2014. It reached number one on the Country Airplay chart in April 2015.

"You Should Be Here", "Middle of a Memory" and "Flatliner" all hit No.1 on Mediabase country radio singles chart.[14]
Swindell also released a music video for the song which featured a video of him telling his father he received a record contract and subsequent montages of Cole and his brothers grieving outside of the family home and at their father's grave. The video also shows images of Swindell's rising popularity while clearly conveying that he wanted to be able to see his father and share this fame experience with him.[15]

Swindell released "Break Up in the End", the lead single from his third album, on February 23, 2018.[16] Swindell's third album, All of It, was released on August 17, 2018.[17] After the album became available for pre-order in July 2018, Swindell released the number-one track "Love You Too Late" as a promotional single.[18] "Love You Too Late" was announced as the album's official second single, being released to radio on November 19, 2018.[19]
The lead single from Swindell's fourth studio album, "Single Saturday Night", was released on May 22, 2020.[20] It was followed by "Never Say Never", a duet with Lainey Wilson, on November 19, 2021.[21] Swindell released his fourth album Stereotype on April 8, 2022.[22] Swindell followed the album up with its third single, "She Had Me at Heads Carolina", a remake of Jo Dee Messina's 1996 single "Heads Carolina, Tails California". This single has gone on to become the biggest single of Swindell's career so far, having spent four weeks at number one on the Country Airplay chart, as well as becoming his first Top 20 single on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified three-times Platinum by RIAA.
