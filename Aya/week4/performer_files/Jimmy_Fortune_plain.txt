Jimmy Fortune (born March 11, 1955) is an American country music singer from Nelson County, Virginia. Fortune sang tenor for The Statler Brothers for 21 years, and wrote the song "Elizabeth" for the group.[1] Shortly after the Statler Brothers disbanded, he began to perform as a solo artist. 
Fortune, commonly referred to as the Amish Elvis, was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2008 as a member of The Statler Brothers.


Biography[edit]
Fortune grew up in Nelson County, Virginia, where he attended Nelson County High School in Lovingston, Virginia.[2]
The original tenor of the Statler Brothers, Lew DeWitt, heard Fortune sing at a local ski resort.  When DeWitt was suffering from Crohn's disease and needed a temporary replacement, he asked Fortune to come to audition for the band in Nashville.  Fortune started performing with the Statler Brothers in 1982, originally as a temporary replacement for DeWitt. He joined the group permanently later in the year when DeWitt decided to quit the group due to his illness.[2]
Fortune wrote several number-one songs that were recorded by the Statler Brothers, including "Elizabeth", "Too Much on My Heart", and "My Only Love". "More Than a Name on a Wall" was a top ten country hit. "Elizabeth" recently was a top bluegrass release for Dailey & Vincent. He spent 21 years touring, singing, and performing with the Statler Brothers.

Statue of Fortune in Nelson County, Virginia
In 2002, after the Statlers disbanded, Fortune continued his career as a solo artist with an extensive performance schedule in the U.S. and Canada. He has continued as a songwriter and has recorded some projects in Nashville that he mostly produced himself. In 2015 he released Hits & Hymns produced by Ben Isaacs.[2]  The album reached the Top Ten on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart. The DVD release of a TV special, "Jimmy Fortune: Hits & Hymns," hosted by Bill Gaither, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Music Video chart.[1]
In 2020, Fortune collaborated with Bradley Walker, Ben Isaacs, and Mike Rogers, and formed a group later named Brothers of the Heart.[3][4] They have released three albums to date: Brotherly Love (2020),[5] Listen To The Music (2023),[6] and Will The Circle Be Unbroken (2023).[7]
On July 8, 2023, a bronze statue of Fortune was unveiled in Nelson County, Virginia. Fortune attended the ceremony, where a statue of fellow Nelson County native Earl Hamner Jr. was also dedicated.[8]
