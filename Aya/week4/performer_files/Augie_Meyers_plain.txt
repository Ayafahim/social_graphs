August "Augie" Meyers (born May 31, 1940)[1] is an American musician, songwriter, studio musician, record producer, and record label owner. He is perhaps best known as a founding member of the Sir Douglas Quintet and the Texas Tornados.[2]


History[edit]
He was born in San Antonio, Texas, United States.[3] In the early 1960s, Meyers and Doug Sahm founded the Sir Douglas Quintet.[3] His Vox organ was a familiar element of the group's sound, as heard on tracks like "She's About a Mover" (1964), "Mendocino" (1969), and "Nuevo Laredo" (1970).[3]
In the 1990s, Meyers co-founded the successful supergroup known as the Texas Tornados with Doug Sahm, Flaco Jiménez, and Freddy Fender.[3]
Since the 1970s, Meyers has operated several of his own record labels, including the Texas Re-Cord Company (co-founded with Lucky Tomblin), Superbeet Records, White Boy Records, and El Sendero.
As a studio musician, Meyers has played on numerous releases by other artists, including Bob Dylan, John P. Hammond, Tom Jones, John & Mary, Tom Waits, Raul Malo, and Doug Sahm.
Meyers lives in the Texas Hill Country town of Bulverde.
