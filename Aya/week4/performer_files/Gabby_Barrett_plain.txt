After Barrett appeared on American Idol, she collaborated with songwriter and producer Allen Foster to write three songs on her extended play The Fireflies: "Fireflies", "Your Name On It", and "Missin' Love".[8]

2019–2021: Goldmine[edit]
Barrett singing during American Idol Live! 2018
In 2019, Barrett independently released "I Hope", which was co-written by Jon Nite and Zachary Kale and co-produced by Zachary Kale and Ross Copperman.[9] She performed the song in an appearance on the seventeenth season of American Idol in May 2019.  The song attracted the attention of music labels, and Barrett announced on stage after the performance she had signed with Warner Music Nashville.[10] "I Hope" was then officially released as a single by the label on June 27, 2019.[9] The single topped Billboard's Country Streaming Songs chart as well as the Country Airplay chart in April 2020, followed by the Hot Country Songs chart.[4][5]
On April 7, 2020, a version featuring Charlie Puth was released. In 2019, Barrett opened for Toby Keith in Ohio, as well as Keith Urban.
On November 21, 2020, the single hit number three on the Billboard Hot 100, making her the first female country artist to do so since Taylor Swift. Puth has also been credited for the song on the Hot 100, which makes it his fourth top-ten single.[11] As of January 2021, the single has been number one for 25 weeks on the Hot Country Songs chart.[12]
Her debut album Goldmine was released on June 19, 2020.[13] The album earned 15.98 million on-demand streams in its opening week, breaking the record for the largest streaming week ever for a debut country album by a woman.[5] In 2021, Barrett opened up for Thomas Rhett on his Center Point Road Tour,[14] and for the Zac Brown Band at Summerfest as part of their The Comeback Tour.[15]
Along with performing at a Pittsburgh Pirates' game, she sang the national anthem for the Pittsburgh Steelers and at the Daytona 500.[16][17] The song on the show selected for her if she won was "Rivers Deep." Carrie Underwood was quoted as saying that Barrett is further along than she was at her age.[18]
In September 2021, Barrett was nominated for four 55th Annual Country Music Association Awards: Female Vocalist of the Year, Single of the Year ("The Good Ones"), Song of the Year ("The Good Ones"), and New Artist of the Year.[19]
A deluxe edition of Goldmine was released on November 19, 2021.[20]

2023–present: Chapter & Verse and acting debut[edit]
She will be making her acting debut in an untitled Trey Edward Shults film, with The Weeknd, Jenna Ortega, and Barry Keoghan costarring.[21] On June 12, 2023, she released "Glory Days", the lead single off her second studio album Chapter & Verse, which was released on February 2, 2024.[22]

Personal life[edit]
Barrett married fellow Idol contestant Cade Foehner on October 5, 2019.[23]
Barrett gave birth to their first child, a daughter, on January 18, 2021.[24] Barrett gave birth to their second child, a son, on October 27, 2022.[25] On August 30, 2023, Barrett announced that she was expecting their third child.[26] Barrett gave birth to their third child, a daughter, on February 17, 2024.[27]
