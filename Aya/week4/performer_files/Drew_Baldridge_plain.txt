Biography[edit]
Drew Baldridge was born in Patoka, Illinois on July 29, 1991. He began performing in local talent contests as a teenager, and moved to Nashville, Tennessee at age 18 to pursue a career in country music. Baldridge released a pair of extended plays digitally between 2014 and 2015. Later on, he released the single "Dance with Ya", which was officially sent to radio and became his first chart entry on Country Airplay. A full studio album, Dirt on Us, came by year's end.[1] In promotion of the album, Baldridge toured with Lee Brice and Cole Swindell.[2]
Baldridge announced a new single, "Guns & Roses", at the end of 2017. The song is intended to be the lead single to his second studio album.[3]
In 2019, Baldridge's label Cold River closed. As a result, he founded his own label called Lyric Ridge in 2020. His first Lyric Ridge release, "She's Somebody's Daughter", was a song he had originally cut on Cold River. Between 2023 and 2024, the song became a viral hit, and went on to become Baldridge's first top-40 hit on the Billboard country charts.[4][5]
