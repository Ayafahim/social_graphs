The Hutchens was an American country music trio from Sandy Ridge, North Carolina composed of brothers Barry, Bill and Bryan Hutchens.[1] They were signed to Atlantic Records and released their debut album, Knock, Knock, in 1995. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album three stars out of five, writing that it "showcases their laid-back country-rock to a fine effect."[2]
Its lead single, the title track, peaked at number 56 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.[1] It received a favorable review from Deborah Evans Price of Billboard, who said that it features "high-energy production, lots of personality in the vocal delivery, and [a] catchy chorus."[3]
