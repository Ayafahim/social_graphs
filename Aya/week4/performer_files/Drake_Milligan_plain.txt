Drake Milligan (born June 1, 1998) is an American singer, best known for portraying Elvis Presley on the CMT series Sun Records and starring in the film Nobody where he portrayed a young teen Elvis. He has also appeared on American Idol and America's Got Talent. Milligan has charted with the singles "Sounds Like Something I'd Do" and "Honky Tonkin' About", the latter of which became his first number one when it topped the Canadian country  chart.[1][2]


Biography[edit]
Drake Milligan was born in Arlington, Texas, on June 1, 1998, to James & Angela Milligan. He was inspired by the country music his father listened to, particularly Merle Haggard, as well as an Elvis impersonator he saw sing at a nearby restaurant. After performing locally as an Elvis impersonator himself, Milligan answered a casting call by CMT for the role of Elvis Presley in their TV series Sun Records (2017). He ended up landing the part, which required him to move from Texas to Nashville, Tennessee, during his senior year of high school.[3]
Milligan competed on American Idol in 2018 but ultimately dropped out. "I decided that I wasn't quite ready for that platform yet, and that it would be a better step for me to move to Nashville and focus on my music first," he said.[4]
While in Nashville, Milligan also auditioned for a recording contract with BBR Music Group. After initially rejecting him, the label signed him six months later. In July 2021, he released his self-titled debut extended play, which was produced by Tony Brown.[5] On October 22, 2021, he released the Christmas song "Cowgirl for Christmas".
Milligan and his band appeared on America's Got Talent on June 8, 2022, receiving four "yes" votes for his performance of an original song, "Sounds Like Something I'd Do". Drake finished the season in 3rd place on September 14, 2022. Drake and his band made a special appearance on an AGT's Results Night, September 13, 2023, performing his new single, "I Got A Problem".
Milligan's debut album, Dallas/Fort Worth was released on September 15, 2022.[6] In October 2022, he made his Grand Ole Opry debut.[7]
In 2023, he collaborated with The Reklaws on the single "Honky Tonkin' About".[8] On September 7, 2023, he released the single, "I Got A Problem".
