Early life[edit]
Callista Clark was born on September 29, 2003.[3][4] Raised in Zebulon, Georgia, Clark claims she was "singing since I could talk", and that the first place she ever sang was at a church where her grandfather was a pastor. Clark told Songwriter Universe that she learned ukulele at the age of 10, and began playing the guitar at the age of 11, later learning more instruments such as the piano.[5] In an interview with iHeartRadio, Clark said that she wrote her first song at the age of 11, initially as a poem in a school poetry contest, which was called "Wildfire".[6] At the age of 12, Clark performed with Jennifer Nettles at a 4-H event.[7][8][9] She gained fame with a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Have You Ever Seen the Rain? posted on Facebook, which received 29 million views.

Career[edit]

"It's 'Cause I Am" was described by Billboard critic Tom Roland as "mining the clash between others' perception of her outward teen appearance and her inner reality", calling her voice's timbre "older than her chronological age".[12] The song reached as high as 22 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart.[13] In an interview with Country Now on May 19, 2021, Clark said that she had "tons of songs from [the beginning of her career] to where I am now that I'm just dying to put out", hinting towards the possible release of new music.[7] On July 30, 2021, Clark debuted at the Grand Ole Opry. She shared the news on her Instagram page on July 16, writing that "this is an absolute dream come true".[14] Clark will be opening on the majority of dates of Chris Young's Famous Friends tour.[15] On October 14, 2022, Clark released her debut album Real to Me: The Way I Feel.[16]
