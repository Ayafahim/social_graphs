Daniele Alexander (born December 2, 1954, in Fort Worth, Texas) is an American country music singer. She began her career as a teenager, performing jazz initially before moving to Las Vegas, Nevada to sing in casinos. She also charted in the Top 20 on the Billboard charts with the single "She's There", a single from her 1989 Mercury Records album First Move.[2] In 1990, she was nominated for Top New Female Vocalist at the Academy of Country Music Awards, along with Jann Browne and Mary Chapin Carpenter, but lost to Carpenter. A second album, I Dream in Color, produced a duet with labelmate Butch Baker in "It Wasn't You, It Wasn't Me," the last chart single for either artist. Alexander exited Mercury in 1991, and later co-wrote two songs on Mila Mason's 1997 debut That's Enough of That.
