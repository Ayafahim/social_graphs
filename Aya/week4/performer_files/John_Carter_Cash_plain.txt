John Carter Cash (born March 3, 1970) is an American country singer-songwriter, musician and author.  He is the only child of Johnny Cash and his second wife June Carter Cash. He is the grandson of Mother Maybelle Carter.[1]


Biography[edit]
With his father, c. 1975
John has four older half-sisters from his father's first marriage to Vivian Cash (née Liberto). They are Rosanne, Kathy, Cindy, and Tara.
He also has two older half-sisters from his mother's previous marriages, singers Carlene Carter and Rosie Nix.
For several years after John's birth, his father altered the conclusion of "A Boy Named Sue" to mention the boy by name. In 1972 his parents recorded the duet "I Got a Boy (And His Name is John)" about their son. In 1975 a photograph of him with his father was featured on the sleeve of the album Look at Them Beans.[citation needed]
Like many of his siblings, John Cash followed his parents into show business. He has worked as a singer-songwriter, musician, and producer. He was music producer on his mother's albums Press On and Wildwood Flower; the latter won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk album.[2]
He was the associate producer of his father's American III: Solitary Man and American IV: The Man Comes Around. In the early 1990s he toured with his father as a rhythm guitarist.  
He has also produced recordings for such artists as: Sheryl Crow, Loretta Lynn, Willie Nelson, Elvis Costello, Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, and Vince Gill. He owns and operates Cash Cabin Enterprises, LLC., a music production company in the Cash Cabin Studio.[3][4]
