Ladies of the Canyon is a Canadian band from Montreal, Quebec composed of Tara Martin, Maia Davies, Jasmine Bleile and Anna Ruddick. Their sound encompasses a melding of influences, such as roots, rock, country, and Americana.  The group has released two albums.


History[edit]
Founded in 2005, Ladies of the Canyon began their career playing small venues in Montreal’s popular Mile-End neighbourhood. At the time their music consisted mainly of "countrified" 1970s Californian soft-rock sound;[1] over time their musical style expanded to include classic folk and contemporary rock.[2]
The group released their first studio album, Haunted Woman, in 2010 through Kindling/Warner Music Canada.[3][4] In the three years following this release, Ladies of the Canyon appeared on stage with  Broken Social Scene and The Dears, were nominated for a Canadian Country Music Association award. The band worked with producer Mark Howard to record their second album, Diamond Heart.[5]  In 2012, during the recording of this album, Sargeant was replaced by drummer Tara Martin.[6] Diamond Heart was released in September, 2013.
In 2014 the Ladies of the Canyon toured with the Barenaked Ladies.[7]

Solo careers[edit]
Maia Davies has launched a solo career by releasing her debut French language album, Héritage, using her mononym Maia (now known as Maia Lily, stylized as Maïa Lily).[8] Jasmine Bleile released her first solo album under the name Satellītes on November 17, 2018.[9] Senja Sargeant released her selftitled EP, produced by Shane Alexander, in 2022 and celebrated the event with a release party in the venue Bitterzoet in Amsterdam where Shane played along in her band.[10][11]
