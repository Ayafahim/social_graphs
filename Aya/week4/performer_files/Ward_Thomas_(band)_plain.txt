Early life[edit]
Catherine and Lizzy are twins, born two minutes apart,[3] who grew up on a farm in rural Hampshire, England, and were educated at Alton School, a Roman Catholic private day school, where they acquired the nicknames "Scruff 1" and "Scruff 2" because they were "so bad at being neat and tidy".[3]
Their father is Anthony Ward-Thomas, who in 1985 founded his own eponymous removals business, now with an annual turnover of £22 million (2015).[4][5][6] Their mother Amanda Ward Thomas is an artist.

In June 2016, Ward Thomas announced a joint venture with Sony Music and that their second album, Cartwheels, would be released in September 2016.[10][non-primary source needed] Lead single "Carry You Home", described by The Times as "chirpy country pop" was released in June, followed by the singles "Guilty Flowers" and "Cartwheels", all of which were added to the Radio 2 playlist. Cartwheels reached number 1 in the UK Albums Chart, making Ward Thomas the first UK country act to top the charts and officially making them the most successful UK country act. It has since gone gold in the UK.[11] In September 2016, Ward Thomas were confirmed to play at the 31st edition of Eurosonic Noorderslag in Groningen[12] and in March 2017, Ward Thomas were announced as the official opening act for the Country to Country 2017 festival.
