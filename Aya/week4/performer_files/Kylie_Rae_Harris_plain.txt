Kylie Rae Harris (May 15, 1989 – September 4, 2019) was an American singer-songwriter.[1][2][3][4] She was born in Wylie, Texas.

Career[edit]
At age twelve, Harris was enrolled in a vocal camp and began crafting her own songs and playing guitar. By the time she graduated from high school, Harris earned a music scholarship and a welding scholarship, but took neither and decided to press on with her musical career. She was one of the featured artists in Troubadour, TX, a television show documenting her rising career as a Texas country singer-songwriter.[5]
On July 1, 2010, Harris released her debut album titled All the Right Reasons,[6] followed by an EP in 2013 titled Taking It Back.[7]
In 2013, Harris began working on material for a second full-length album and toured with fellow Troubadour, TX star Zane Williams throughout the state.[8] Then in March 2019, she released a new self titled EP.[9]

Death[edit]
Harris died on September 4, 2019, when her car collided with another near Taos, New Mexico. She was 30 years old[10][11] and is survived by her daughter.[12] A subsequent investigation, completed in December 2019, revealed she had been driving up to 102 mph (164 km/h) (95 mph (153 km/h) when the crash occurred), confirmed by her vehicle's computer, and had a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit. Harris clipped the rear end of a vehicle in the right lane, swerved into oncoming traffic,[13][14] and hit another car head-on.  The driver of the other car, 16-year-old Taos High School student Maria Elena Cruz, was also killed.[15] Cruz's father, Deputy Chief Pedro Cruz of the San Cristobal Fire District, responded to the call not knowing his daughter had been involved in the accident.[16]
Harris had a drunk driving conviction from 2017. As part of her conviction, she was ordered to have an ignition interlock device installed in her car.[17][relevant?]
