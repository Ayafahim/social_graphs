Wilton Frederick "Freddy" Weller (born September 9, 1943)[1] is an American rock and roll and country music and artist. He recorded for Columbia Records between 1969 and 1980. He had his highest charted single in 1969 with his debut release, "Games People Play".


Biography[edit]
Early career[edit]
He was born in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.[2] Weller played in a high school group, The Believers, which also included Joe South.[2] One of his first recording sessions was playing guitar on Billy Joe Royal's 1965 track, "Down in the Boondocks", which was written by South.[2]

Paul Revere & the Raiders[edit]
Main article: Paul Revere & the Raiders § The "Happening" era
His recording career continued in 1967, as lead guitarist in the band Paul Revere & The Raiders.[2]  Around the time he joined the band, the group's two main members, Mark Lindsay and Paul Revere, had just started hosting the show Happening '68. The other Raiders members, Charlie Coe, Keith Allison, and Joe Correro Jr, acted as the show's in-studio houseband. He penned their 1969 hit "We Gotta All Get Together".[3]
Weller remained in the Raiders until its split in 1975. The group soon reformed without Weller.

Solo[edit]
Weller recorded many rock and roll and country songs, such as Joe South's "'Games People Play", which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1969;[2] Chuck Berry's "The Promised Land" and "Too Much Monkey Business", "She Loves Me Right Out Of My Mind", "Indian Lake", both 1971, and many others. Weller also played guitar backing for both South and Royal.[1] He co-wrote "Dizzy" and "Jam Up and Jelly Tight", which were hits for Tommy Roe in 1969 and 1970.[2]
After releasing his 1980 single "Lost In Austin" and his 1982 studio album Ramblin' Man, Weller would semi-retire from the music industry, not making another release for thirty years, when he released the single "Your Memory Walks Through Walls" in 2010.
