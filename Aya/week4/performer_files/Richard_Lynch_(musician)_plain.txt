Life and career[edit]
Lynch was born in Lebanon, Ohio, and raised on a 110-acre farm[4] that his family operated. From his father Woody Lynch,[5] an established local musician, Richard inherited the love for country music and lifestyle.[6][7] At the age of 13 Richard picked up the guitar and learned to play. By the age of 15 he got his first gig at a wedding reception. At the age of 18[8] he organized his own band (the Renegade Band[9] later renamed the Richard Lynch Band) and has been successfully recording and touring ever since.
Lynch refers to his music as "pure country, showcasing elements of western swing, honky tonk and outlaw country".[10] His style is influenced by classic American country artists like Keith Whitley, Conway Twitty and George Strait.[11]
In January 2017 Lynch collaborated with Ronnie McDowell on a military tribute duet "Love Tattoo".[12][13]
On April 1, 2017, Lynch's third studio album "Mending Fences" was released via an independent record label, Fence Row Records[14] The album features a duet with a bluegrass singer Rhonda Vincent.[15]
Lynch co-hosts “Traditionally Lynch” show on Renegade Radio Nashville.
Lynch is also an accomplished designer and builder of barns.[16] He resides in Waynesville, Ohio, with his wife Donna.[17]
