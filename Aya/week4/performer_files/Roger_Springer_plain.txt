Roger Springer (born June 15, 1962, in Caddo, Oklahoma) is an American country music artist. Springer's only single as a solo artist, "The Right One Left," was released in 1992 on MCA Nashville and peaked at No. 69 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.
In 1998, Springer formed the country music trio Springer! with Shara Johnson and Joe Manuel.[1] Their first single, "Don't Try to Find Me," peaked at No. 64 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.[2] A second single, "Ain't Nothing but a Cloud," was released in 1999 but failed to chart. Renamed The Roger Springer Band, Giant released the trio's eponymous debut album in July 1999 shortly before they disbanded.
As a songwriter, Springer has co-written single releases by Mark Chesnutt ("I Might Even Quit Lovin' You," "It's a Little Too Late," "Let It Rain," "Thank God for Believers"), Sammy Kershaw ("Matches")[1][3] and Love and Theft ("Dancing in Circles").
