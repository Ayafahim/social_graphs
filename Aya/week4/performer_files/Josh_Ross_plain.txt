Josh Ross (born May 27, 1996) is a Canadian country singer and songwriter. He is managed by The Core Entertainment and jointly signed to Universal Music Canada and Universal Music Group Nashville.[1][2] Ross has charted with the singles "First Taste of Gone", "On a Different Night", "Trouble",  "Ain't Doin' Jack", and "Single Again".[3] In March 2024, he released the extended play Complicated.[4]


Early life[edit]
Ross was born in Waterdown, Ontario, and later moved to nearby Burlington, Ontario for school.[5][6] He spent most of his youth playing sports such as hockey, football, soccer, and motocross.[7] He has extended family in Los Angeles and Maine, and visited the United States often as a child.[8] Ross attended Western University on a football scholarship and was a defensive back.[9] He had hoped to play in the Canadian Football League.[7] A series of injuries coupled with two surgeries derailed his football career in university,[8] and he elected to pursue a career in music as a result.[7] Before his solo career, he initially formed a band in 2016 with Will Finch, a fellow former Western football player, named "Silver Lining".[10] Ross listened to both country and rock music growing up, and cites Steve Earle as one of his biggest musical influences.[7][11]

Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
While working in construction management, Ross entered several music competitions including the Magna Hoedown in Aurora, Ontario, and the Boots and Hearts Emerging Artists Showcase.[7] He began making trips to Nashville, Tennessee in 2018, with the support of fellow Canadian country artist Aaron Goodvin, before making a permanent move there in 2019.[7] Ross released his first radio single "If You Were a Song" as an independent artist that year.[12] He released the five-song extended play Do What You Love in 2020.[7]

2022–2023: Universal Music Group, Grey Cup halftime show[edit]
In February 2022, Ross released the single "First Taste of Gone", which he co-wrote with Mason Thornley.[13] He then became one of the final eight finalists for SiriusXM's "Top of the Country" contest.[14] Ross subsequently signed a joint recording and management deal with The Core Entertainment and Universal Music Canada in April 2022.[1] With Universal taking over promotion of "First Taste of Gone", the song moved into the top five of the Canada Country chart,[3] and entered the Canadian Hot 100.[15] Ross released the song "On a Different Night" in July 2022,[16][17][18] which would become a radio single later that September.[19] He received a nomination for "Rising Star" at the 2022 Canadian Country Music Awards.[20] Ross performed at the halftime show for the 109th Grey Cup in Regina, Saskatchewan, alongside Tyler Hubbard and Jordan Davis.[21]
In January 2023, Ross released the single "Trouble".[22] He opened for Bailey Zimmerman at the end of his headlining tour in the United States in the same month.[23] In March 2023, Universal Music Group Nashville signed Ross in partnership with Universal Music Canada and The Core.[24][25] Ross subsequently released the song "Red Flags" later that month.[26][27] He joined Lee Brice's "Beer Drinking Opportunity Tour" with Tenille Arts in Canada in the spring of 2023, and signed a publishing deal with Warner Chappell Music shortly thereafter.[28][29][30] He was named "Rising Star" at the 2023 Country Music Association of Ontario Awards.[31] In the summer of 2023, Ross was an opening act for Nickelback on their North American "Get Rollin' Tour" along with Brantley Gilbert.[32] In July 2023, he released the song "Ain't Doin' Jack".[33] That same month, he made his debut performance at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee.[34] At the 2023 Canadian Country Music Awards in September 2023, Ross was nominated in six total categories, and won the award for "Breakthrough Artist or Group of the Year".[35][36] He released the song "Ain't the One" at the end of the month.[37]

2024-present: Complicated, The Trouble Tour, and the Single Again Tour[edit]
In 2024, Ross released the songs "Single Again" and "Truck Girl".[38] Ross also embarked on his debut headlining tour "The Trouble Tour" in Canada in early 2024, and he joined Bailey Zimmerman again for his headlining "Religiously: The Tour"  in the United States, Great Britain, and Ireland.[39][38] He released his extended play Complicated on March 29, 2024.[40] He followed that up with the release of the promotional singles "New Me" in May 2024 and "Want This Beer", a duet with Julia Michaels, in July 2024.[41][42] From August to November 2024, Ross will embark on his debut American headlining tour, the "Single Again Tour".[43] He won five awards at the 2024 Canadian Country Music Awards, including "Entertainer of the Year" and "Single of the Year.[44]
