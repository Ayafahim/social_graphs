Early life[edit]
Kimberly Michelle Pate was born on March 4, 1982, in Memphis, Tennessee.[14] As a child, Michelle learned to play piano and guitar, and took voice lessons from Bob Westbrook, who also trained pop singers Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears. She graduated from Overton High School in Memphis in 2000.[15][16] She earned a music scholarship to Florida A&M University (FAMU) by yodeling at her audition. She was crowned the Freshman Attendant of the Homecoming Court at the age of 18.[17] She is a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated, pledging Beta Alpha chapter Fall of 2001.[18] She reports that she stopped attending classes for a short time to have a son born in September 2004, then returned to finish college.[19] She graduated from FAMU with honors and was accepted into several law schools but did not attend, opting to pursue music full-time.[20][21][22]
Michelle's age was reported in her college yearbook as 18 in late 2000, which would put her birth year at 1982.[17] Her age was reported as 31 in 2015 by The Source magazine, which would put her birth year at 1984.[23] AllMusic's biography of her initially gave a birth year of 1986, then in 2022 reported only “1980s”, but in 2023 the year was changed to 1982.[24] Michelle gave 1986 in a 2013 interview.[25][26] The editor of "GossipWeLove.com" commented on the discrepancies in reported birth year, registering disbelief that Michelle could have entered college, and won her class's prom beauty contest, at age 14. Michelle formed a college friendship with Basketball Wives actress Royce Reed who was born in 1981.[27]

Career[edit]

In 2009, Michelle signed a deal with Jive Records and released her first R&B-charting single, "Fakin' It", featuring Missy Elliott.[4] The song peaked at number 100 on the U.S. Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. During 2010, Michelle released three follow-up singles, "Fallin'", "I Just Can't Do This" and "How Many Times", which charted at numbers 56, 53, and 53 respectively on the U.S. Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[28] At the time, Michelle was in the process of recording her debut album, originally titled Pain Medicine, which was slated to have features from artists such as Trina,[29][30] Gucci Mane, Akon, Usher, and R. Kelly, who she would credit as her mentor during this period.[31] However, her album was scrapped when Jive Records folded in 2011.

On the same day, she shared a lengthy message to her supporters on Instagram where she called her fifth album a "masterpiece." She wrote, "Where do I begin? Well first I just want to say thank you for loving on me. The last two years have been a real journey and growing experience for me. I literally was fighting for my life. I know I've had you guys waiting for my album so I wanted to give you something to vibe to until then. You know for years now we've had fun together remixing my favorite songs."[73] On January 10, she revealed cover art and tracklist for All Monsters Are Human and made the album available for pre-order on digital retailers Apple Music and Amazon.[74][75]
