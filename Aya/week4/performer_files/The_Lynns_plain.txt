The Lynns are an American country music duo, consisting of twin sisters Peggy Lynn and Patsy Lynn (born August 6, 1964[2]), who are the youngest daughters of Oliver Lynn and singer Loretta Lynn.[1]
They recorded one album for Reprise Records, which charted two singles on Hot Country Songs. The Lynns have received CMA Award nominations for Vocal Duo of the Year in 1998 and 1999.[3][4]
Their album was met with mixed reception. Peter Margasak of Chicago Reader wrote that "musically they don't show much more spunk. Their singing...is no match for their mother's, but they're certainly not alone there....most of the material is typical Nashville mush: weepy ballads and tame, predictable rockers."[5] Jason Ankeny of AllMusic praised the duo's "powerful voices" but criticized the "formulaic production".[6]
Patsy's daughter, Emmy Russell, auditioned for season 22 of American Idol, making the cut and earning the golden ticket to Hollywood.[7]
