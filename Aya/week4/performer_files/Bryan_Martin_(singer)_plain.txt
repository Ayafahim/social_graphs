Bryan Martin is an American country music singer. In 2023 and 2024, Martin had his first charted entry with the single "We Ride".


Biography[edit]
Martin was born in Logansport, Louisiana. As a teenager, he worked on an oil rig in addition to playing American football and bull riding. He broke his collar bone doing the latter, after which he developed an addiction to painkillers. After this, he briefly enlisted in the United States Army and, after an attempted suicide, began recording music.[1]
Martin released the albums If It Was Easy in 2019 and Self Inflicted Scars two years later. In late 2022, his song "We Ride", released through Average Joes Entertainment, began receiving attention on TikTok. By 2023, "We Ride" had begun charting on the Billboard Country Airplay charts, also reaching the Billboard Hot 100 in early 2024. The song is on Martin's third album Poets & Old Souls.[2][3]
Following the song's release, Martin was booked as an opening act for Morgan Wallen and Warren Zeiders.[1][4]
