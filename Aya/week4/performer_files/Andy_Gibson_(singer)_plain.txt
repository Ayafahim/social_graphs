Andy Gibson (born September 15, 1981) is an American country music singer.  He co-wrote "Don't You Wanna Stay", a duet between Jason Aldean and Kelly Clarkson which reached No. 1 on the country music charts in 2011. Later in the year, he signed to R&J Records and released his debut single, "Wanna Make You Love Me".[1] Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song four stars out of five, saying that it "begin[s] gathering attention after frequent listens."[2] The song has been made into a music video directed by David McClister, which has aired on CMT.[3] Gibson moved to Curb Records in April 2012 following the closure of R&J,[4][5] although some R&J staff continued promotion of "Wanna Make You Love Me".[6] Gibson's first Curb single, "Summer Back", entered the charts in late 2012.
