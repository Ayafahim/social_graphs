Bruce Guthro ONS (August 31, 1961 – September 5, 2023) was a Canadian singer-songwriter from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. Guthro recorded as a solo artist, and was lead vocalist for the Scottish Celtic rock band Runrig from 1998,[1] until the group retired in 2018.[2] Guthro received several ECMAs (East Coast Music Awards),[3] and hosted and conceptualized the Canadian TV show Songwriters Circle, on which guests included Jim Cuddy, Colin James, and Alan Doyle (of the Canadian band Great Big Sea).[4]
Guthro was also the father of musicians Dylan Guthro and Jodi Guthro.[5][6] He co-produced Dylan's award-winning 2012 debut album All That's True with Dave Gunning and co-wrote five of the album's songs.[5][7]
Guthro died from cancer on September 5, 2023, five days after his 62nd birthday.[8] On October 4, 2023, he was posthumously appointed a member of the Order of Nova Scotia for contributions to the music industry, Canadian culture and philanthropy.[9]
