Turner Nichols was an American country music duo composed of singer-songwriters Zack Turner and Tim Nichols. Signed to BNA Records in 1993, the duo recorded a self-titled debut album for the label that year, with two of that album's singles charting on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts. Although it was their only recording together, both members of the duo wrote several songs together in the 1990s, including hit singles for Keith Whitley and Jo Dee Messina.


History[edit]
Since the late 1980s, both Zack Turner and Tim Nichols had written hits for other artists, including "I'm Over You", a Top Five hit for Keith Whitley in 1990,[1] as well as a cut on Travis Tritt's debut album Country Club.[1]
Turner and Nichols signed to BNA Entertainment (now known as BNA Records) in 1993 as the duo Turner Nichols.[2] Their self-titled debut album was released that year, with two of its singles reaching the Billboard country charts.[2] Entertainment Weekly reviewer Alanna Nash gave the album a "B" rating, noting the "soulful lyrics and real emotional connections" on cuts such as "Moonlight Drive-In", the first single.[3] "Moonlight Drive-In" peaked at No. 51 on the Billboard country charts, and was followed by "She Loves to Hear Me Rock" at No. 49. These songs respectively reached No. 36 and No. 39 on the RPM Country Tracks charts in Canada.
After exiting BNA in 1993, both members of the duo continued to write songs for other artists, including Jo Dee Messina's 1996 hit "You're Not in Kansas Anymore." Nichols went on to win a Grammy Award for co-writing Tim McGraw's single "Live Like You Were Dying."
