Early life[edit]

Career[edit]
2009–2012: Way Out Here and Change[edit]
Thompson moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 2005.[3][4] He worked as a songwriter, with his first cut being the title track to Jason Michael Carroll's album Growing Up Is Getting Old.[5] By 2009, Thompson had signed to Columbia Records' Nashville division. He released his debut single "Beer on the Table" in late 2009,[6] and it debuted at No. 55 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts dated for the week ending August 15, 2009.[7] This song was followed by a four-song digital extended play which included that song and three other tracks.[8]

Way Out Here, his debut album, was released in February 2010 under the production of Michael Knox.[2][3] Thompson wrote or co-wrote every one of the album's ten tracks,[4] and promoted the album at the Northern Lights Theatre in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[9]
"Beer on the Table" peaked at number 17 on the country music charts. The album's second single, its title track, was released to radio in March 2010. Besides the two singles, the tracks "Won't Be Lonely Long" and "Blame It on Waylon" were made into music videos. Starting in February 2010, Thompson began touring with Eric Church on a 32-stop tour[4] and was tapped for portions of Brad Paisley's 2010 H2O Tour.[10] The album's third single "Won't Be Lonely Long" released to country radio on November 22, 2010. Thompson also co-wrote "Church Pew or Bar Stool", a song recorded by Jason Aldean on his 2010 album My Kinda Party. In 2011 he co-wrote a song on Brad Paisley's album This Is Country Music the song is entitled "A Man Don't Have to Die".
In August 2011, Thompson and labelmate Miranda Lambert transferred to RCA Nashville as part of a corporate restructuring.[11] He released his first RCA Records single, "Comin' Around", in late 2011. However, Thompson parted ways with RCA Nashville in July 2012.[12]

2013–present: Turn It Up[edit]
In September 2012 it was announced that Thompson had signed a recording contract with Show Dog-Universal Music and will release new music sometime in 2013.[13] Also in 2013, he co-wrote James Wesley's single "Thank a Farmer" with Dustin Lynch and Steve Bogard.[14]
His first Show Dog single, "Cold Beer with Your Name on It", entered the charts in late 2013 and reached Top 30 on Country Airplay. It is the lead single from his first Show Dog-Universal album, Turn It Up. The album's second single "Wanted Me Gone" was released on April 28, 2014. Thompson parted ways with Show Dog in 2015.
Thompson announced in August 2015 that he would be releasing his unreleased second album for RCA as a pair of extended plays. The first of the two, Change: The Lost Record, Vol. 1, was released in October.[15] Thompson, along with Deric Ruttan, co-wrote Jason Aldean's number one hit Any Ol' Barstool.
