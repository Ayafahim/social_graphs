Jolie Holland (born September 11, 1975)[1] is an American singer and performer who combines elements of folk, traditional, experimental, and rock.[2]


Career[edit]
Holland at the keyboards
Growing up in her birth place of Houston, Texas,[1] Holland left in 1994, moving to Austin, New Orleans, and San Francisco before ending up in Vancouver, Canada, where she was one of the founding members of The Be Good Tanyas. Holland left the band before the release of their debut album, Blue Horse, on which she appears prominently.[3] She returned to San Francisco, where she recorded her first album, 2002's Catalpa.[4] Originally self-released, the album was later picked up and re-released by ANTI-. In 2004 she released her first album for ANTI-, 2004's Escondida. ANTI- labelmates Tom Waits and Sage Francis are both outspoken fans of Holland's: Waits nominated her for the Shortlist music prize,[5] while Francis has said that Escondida was his most listened to album of 2005.[6]
As well as releasing another four solo albums for ANTI- and touring globally, Holland has performed a number of collaborations with other artists, including with fan Sage Francis (on his album Human the Death Dance) and Booker T. (with whom she recorded "What A Wonderful World" in 2007). In 2016, she reunited with Be Good Tanyas bandmate Samantha Parton and they began touring as a duo,[7] releasing the jointly-credited album Wildflower Blues, on Cinquefoil Records, in 2017 and embarking on a joint tour through 2018.[8]
