Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
Hummon was born in Washington, D.C.[1] His father worked for the United States Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development and he spent much of his childhood in Africa, Italy,[1] Tanzania, Nigeria, the
Philippines, and Saudi Arabia.[2] He sang in church as a child and his first performance as a musician was playing African drums on Nigerian TV.[2] He moved back to the Washington metropolitan area as a junior in high school, living in Potomac, Maryland and Bethesda, Maryland.[2][3] His parents were musicians and theatre buffs and exposed him to the arts, regularly attending performances.[3] As a teen, he played in a group with his three sisters.[4] He attended Bullis School, where he played running back and graduated in 1980.[2] He graduated from Williams College in 1984.[5]

Career[edit]
Following college, in 1984, he moved to Los Angeles to seek a recording contract but was unsuccessful.[4] In 1986, Hummon moved to Nashville.[3] He played at the Bluebird Café and other clubs.[4][6] He was eventually signed to a songwriting contract and then a recording contract with Columbia Records. Hummon met Joe Henry, who collaborated with John Denver, and offered to help him write songs.[7] The first notable song that he wrote was "Pilgrims on the Way", recorded by Michael Martin Murphey in 1988.[6]
His debut album All in Good Time (1995) included the song "God's Country", which reached number 73  on the Hot Country Songs record charts.[8] It also included "Bless the Broken Road", with backing vocals by co-writer Jeff Hanna and Matraca Berg and "One of These Days". The songs and title of the album reference his Christian faith.[9] From 1999 to 2001, Hummon was a member of the alternative country band The Raphaels along with former Big Country lyricist and guitarist Stuart Adamson. The Raphaels' only release was Supernatural in 1998 on Track Records.[10] In 1997, Hummon formed his own label, Velvet Armadillo, on which he released several studio albums.[11]

Also in 2006, Selah recorded the song and it charted on the Hot Christian Songs chart.
In 2009, Hummon's first book, Anytime, Anywhere: A Little Boy’s Prayer, a children's book, was published by Simon & Schuster.[12][11]
Hummon wrote Surrender Road, an opera staged by The Nashville Opera Company in 2005. Another opera, Favorite Son, produced with the Nashville Opera in February 2022, featuring Darrel Scott and John Riesen was nominated for a Regional Emmy for musical composition.[13][14]
Hummon also wrote six musicals, three of which were featured as part of the New York Musical Theatre Festival in 2005, 2006 and 2011.[1] His musical American Prophet, about the life of Frederick Douglass, co-written with Charles Randolph-Wright, premiered at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. in August 2022 and won the Edgerton Award that year.[13][15]
