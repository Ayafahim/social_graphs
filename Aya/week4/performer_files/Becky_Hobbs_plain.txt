Becky Hobbs (born January 24, 1950)[1] is an American country singer, songwriter and pianist. She has recorded seven studio albums, and has charted multiple singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including the 1983 Top Ten hit "Let's Get Over Them Together", a duet with Moe Bandy.[2]
Besides her work as a solo artist, Hobbs has written for several country and pop acts, such as Helen Reddy, George Jones, Loretta Lynn, and Shelly West. With Candy Parton she co-wrote Alabama's 1985 song, "I Want to Know You Before We Make Love", later covered by Conway Twitty in 1987.[2]
