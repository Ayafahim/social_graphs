Gil Grand (born Gilles Lagrandeur, January 8, 1968) is a Canadian country music singer. Since 1998, he has released three studio albums: Famous First Words (1998), Burnin' (2002) and Somebody's Someone (2006).[1] He has charted several singles on the Canadian country singles charts as well, including the RPM top ten single "Famous First Words" in 1998.


Career[edit]
In 1998, Grand signed a record deal with Monument Records' Nashville division. His debut album, Famous First Words, helped him receive three Canadian Country Music Awards nominations including Male Vocalist of the Year, Album of the Year and Wrangler Rising Star.
Burnin' was released in December 2002. "Cry A Little," "Break It to Them Gently," "Run" and the title track were all released as singles. Grand earned five CCMA nominations in 2003 including Single of the Year, SOCAN Song of the Year, Video of the Year, and Best Album Graphics, and won Independent Male Artist of the Year.
He released his third album, Somebody's Someone, in March 2006. In 2006, Grand and his younger brother Jake joined forces for Raise the Roof, a tour that took them from British Columbia to Ontario, raising awareness of Ronald McDonald House Charities. Grand now lives in Nashville where he is co-owner and president of Grand & Gee Music Group.
