Morgan Dealie Wade (born December 10, 1994) is an American country music singer. Active since 2018, she released the album Reckless in 2021, followed by Psychopath in 2023 and Obsessed in 2024.


Biography[edit]
Early life and career[edit]
Morgan Wade is a native of Floyd, Virginia. She began writing songs as a freshman in college, and in 2018, she recruited musicians through Craigslist to record her first album Puppets with My Heart, which was credited to the Stepbrothers. Wade told Rolling Stone Country that she was inspired to do this after breaking up with her boyfriend.[1] Wade later said that the stress of touring and recording with the Stepbrothers led to her developing an alcohol addiction.[1]
Later in 2018, Wade was performing at FloydFest along with many artists including Jason Isbell. Isbell's sound engineer gave her album to Sadler Vaden, the guitarist in Isbell's band the 400 Unit.[2]

Reckless (2021–2022)[edit]
Sadler Vaden and producer Paul Ebersold then helped her assemble another album over the next two years. Titled Reckless, the album was released via the Thirty Tigers label in 2021.[3] Selling 3,000 copies in its first week, Reckless charted at number 14 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers charts. Wade told the publication that the album was inspired by her struggles with her mental health, past relationships, and sobriety.[4] Rolling Stone Country describes the album by saying that Wade has "the ragged edge of a singer-songwriter who’s been putting her nose to the grindstone for some time. In a voice like worn leather, Wade describes desperate, spontaneous relationships that feel the strongest when they’re at their breaking point."[1]
"Wilder Days" was released to radio in 2021 as the album's first single. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country described Wade's vocal presence on the song as a "hardened Sheryl Crow" and called the song "complex, with chords and a melancholy shuffle that shouts heartbreak, even if her story is at worst hesitant and thoughtful."[5]
Wade released the single "Run" on January 5, 2022[6] ahead of the deluxe edition release of Reckless on January 28. The deluxe edition of the album included six bonus tracks. One of them is a cover of Elvis Presley's 1969 hit "Suspicious Minds".[7] The re-release was issued through Arista Nashville.[8]

Psychopath and Obsessed (2023–present)[edit]
On May 19, 2023, Wade released a song titled "Psychopath," the lead single to her third album of the same name slated for release in August. To promote the album, she began a tour which included stops in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[9]  On July 10, she released a second single "80's Movies"[10] followed by the third single entitled "Fall in Love with Me" which was released on August 4.[11]
On March 1, 2024, Wade released a song titled "2AM in London,"[12] the lead single to her fourth album Obsessed. On April 12, the second titled "Time to Love, Time to Kill" was released.  Along with release of the single, Wade announced Obsessed with a release date of August 16.[13]
In 2023, Alanis Morisette announced a 2024 North American summer tour with guest performers Morgan Wade and Joan Jett. Named "The Triple Moon Tour", the 31-stop event started June 9 in Phoenix, Arizona.[14]

Personal life[edit]
In May 2023, Wade revealed in a Page Six exclusive that she tested for the RAD5ID gene — a mutation in one of the breast cancer genes.[15]  In November, she had a double mastectomy as a result.  She took the rest of the year off to rest and recover.  Within a statement to Page Six, Wade said, "My mom had it, and my little cousin is going to get it, but I’ll be fine." She added that she got the news last year (2022) during her tour dates in Europe.[15]

Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.
