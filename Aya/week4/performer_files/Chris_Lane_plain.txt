Christopher Eric Lane (born November 9, 1984) is an American country music singer and songwriter. He has released one album as frontman of the Chris Lane Band, a second album, Girl Problems, and a third album, Laps Around the Sun. via Big Loud Records. Lane has charted seven singles on Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay, three of which went to No. 1 ("Fix", "I Don't Know About You", and "Big, Big Plans").


Early life and career beginnings[edit]
Lane grew up in Kernersville, North Carolina, and has a twin brother named Cory.[4] While attending Glenn High School, he and his brother played football and baseball, and both went on to play baseball in college at University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Lane learned to play the guitar when sports injuries affected his chances of a professional baseball career.  In his hometown he worked for his father's landscaping business and started a cover band that played in High Point University cafeteria. In 2007, Lane and his brother auditioned for the seventh season of American Idol  but did not make it to Hollywood.[5] It wasn't until 2008 when Chris’s high school friend Brent Eliason introduced  him to Seth England of Big Loud Mountain and told his 'Uncle Seth' he had to listen to his mixtape. This was the moment which launched Chris's career as an up-and-coming country music artist.[4][6][7]

Career[edit]
Before pursuing a solo career, Lane fronted the Chris Lane Band.[8] Their album Let's Ride charted on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart in 2012.[9] He moved to Nashville in 2013.[6] Lane has opened for The Band Perry, Eli Young Band, Lee Brice, Chris Young and Brantley Gilbert, among others.[10] In 2014, he opened for Florida Georgia Line on their This Is How We Roll Tour.[11][12]

Lane's debut single, "Broken Windshield View", was released to country radio on June 10, 2014, by Big Loud Mountain.[10] The song was written by Rodney Clawson, Shane Minor, and David Lee Murphy and produced by Joey Moi.[4][13] It was featured on Sirius XM's The Highway and iTunes' New and Noteworthy.[10] It sold 11,000 downloads in its first week of release[14] and reached number 45 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.[15] As of August 2014, it has sold 43,000 downloads.[16][17] It was also included on an extended play.[4][13]
Lane released his debut album Girl Problems in August 2016. It accounted for the singles "Fix" and "For Her".[2] His second album, Laps Around the Sun, produced the duet "Take Back Home Girl" (featuring Tori Kelly) and "I Don't Know About You".[2] In 2019, "Big, Big Plans" was released and became his third number one on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, but it was never included on an album, and after "Fill Them Boots" failed to reach the top 40 of the chart in 2021, he parted ways with Big Loud.
In 2021, he featured on the single "Tailgate to Heaven" by Canadian country artist Shawn Austin.[18]
Lane signed a joint venture with his own imprint Voyager Records and the newly-developed Red Street Records in 2023 and "Find Another Bar" will be released on August 21, 2023, as his first single for the label.[19]

Personal life[edit]

They got engaged on June 16, 2019.[20] The two married in Nashville on October 25, 2019.[21] On December 6, 2020, Lane and Bushnell announced they were expecting their first child.[22] On January 1, 2021, it was revealed that the baby would be a son.[23] On June 8, 2021, their son was born.[24] On June 6, 2022, Lane and Bushnell announced that they were expecting their second child in late October.[25] On October 16, 2022, their second son was born.[26]
