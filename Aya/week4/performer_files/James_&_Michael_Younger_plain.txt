James & Michael Younger, also known as The Younger Brothers, were an American country music group from Edinburg, Texas composed of brothers James and Michael Williams.


History[edit]
Their eponymous debut album was released in 1983 by MCA Records. Its first single, "Nothing but the Radio On," reached the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1982.[1] An uncredited review in The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the duo's album a two-star rating, praising their vocal harmonies but criticizing the lack of variety in tempo.[2] After exiting MCA, the duo recorded a number of singles for the Permian and AIR labels, then disbanded in 1986.[1]
