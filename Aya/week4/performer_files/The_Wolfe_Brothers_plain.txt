The Wolfe Brothers are an Australian country music duo consisting of brothers Tom and Nick Wolfe. The group formerly included childhood friends Brodie Rainbird and Casey Kostiuk. The Wolfe Brothers rose to prominence after placing second in season six of Australia's Got Talent.


Career[edit]
Early years to 2012: Formation and Australia's Got Talent[edit]
Tom and Nick Wolfe grew up on a small berry farm outside Hobart, Tasmania. Their father Malcolm and uncle Tony played in a band with their parents, called The Wolfe Family Orchestra.[1]
Nick Wolfe says, "We come from four generations of farmers and musicians." Their father guided Nick to the guitar and Tom to the piano, perhaps with "the intention of starting a band with us". Their mother filled the family home with music, exposing her children to 1990s country staples like Garth Brooks and Billy Ray Cyrus.[2]
The Wolfe Brothers were formed by brothers Nick (guitar and vocals) and Tom Wolfe (bass and vocals), Brodie Rainbird (guitar) and Casey Kostiuk (drums).[3][1] During their high school years all four played in different bands, covering songs by their glam rock and heavy metal music heroes. After leaving school they formed The Wolfe Brothers, and for six years played covers in pubs and clubs across Tasmania.[4]
In May 2010, The Wolfe Brothers self-released a self-titled debut EP.[5]
In 2012, The Wolfe Brothers auditioned for the sixth season of Australia's Got Talent, where they placed second behind Andrew De Silva.[6]

2013–2019: It's On to Country Heart[edit]

In January 2013, The Wolfe Brothers released their debut studio album It's On, which peaked at number 18 on the ARIA Charts. The album spawned three county top 10 singles, including their first #1 song and #1 video "The Girl, The Bottle, The Memory".[4]
The Wolfe Brothers were special guests on Lee Kernaghan's 2013–2014 Beautiful Noise Tour.[7]
At the 2014 Country Music Awards of Australia, The Wolfe Brothers were nominated for four awards and won the New Australian Artist of the Year at the CMC Music Awards.[8][9]
In September 2014, The Wolfe Brothers released their second studio album, Nothin' But Trouble, which peaked at number 13 on the ARIA Charts. The album spawned the single "That Kinda Night", which reached number 1 on the country singles chart.[10] The album's second and third singles, "You Got to Me" and "Born and Bred" became the group's third and fourth number 1 on the country charts and the CMC video chart.[4]
In September 2015, a live album titled Live at CMC Rocks QLD 2015 was released.[4]
The group supported Kernaghan on his 2015 The Songs and the Stories Tour. Tom Wolfe later saying, "Touring with Lee has been a dream come true for us. He has taught us so much and it is still a little surreal to look across the stage and realise we are actually performing with one of our childhood heroes – the great Lee Kernaghan".[4]
In June 2016, the group released their third studio album, This Crazy Life album, which peaked at number 10 on the ARIA charts. The album was recorded in Nashville, USA over three months between November 2015 and February 2016 under the guidance of producer Luke Wooten.[4]
In 2016, The Wolfe Brothers were nominated in three categories in the CMC Music Awards, winning the CMC Group of the Year Award; their second CMC Award.[4][11]
Late in 2016, Nick and Tom's father, Malcolm died of cancer.[1]
In 2017 they recorded the single "Damn Good Mates" with Lee Kernaghan for Kernaghan's 25th Anniversary Album. In 2017 The Wolfe Brothers won Australian Group/Duo of the Year at the Planet Country's Music for a New Generation Awards.[12]
In April 2018, the group released their fourth studio album Country Heart, which peaked at number 9 on the ARIA Charts. The singles "Ain't Seen It Yet" and "Country Heart" both reaching number 1 on the country singles chart.[13][14]
At the 2019 Country Music Awards of Australia, the group won including Album of the Year, Contemporary Country Album of the Year, Group or Duo of the Year and  Song of the Year with "Ain't Seen It Yet".[15][16]

2020–present: Kids on Cassette to Livin' the Dream[edit]
In March 2020, Brodie Rainbird announced he is leaving the group as Casey Kostiuk had done some years earlier. However, both continue to play with the duo on tour.[17]
In April 2020 the band worldwide deal with global independent label, BMG, in partnership with the BBR Music Group.[18][19]
On 17 April 2020, the group released their first single on the label entitled "No Breaks".[20]
The Wolfe Brothers' fifth studio album, Kids on Cassette was released in July 2021, the same day they celebrated their 15th consecutive #1 single on the Country Airplay Charts with "Startin' Something"[21] The album debuted at number 6 on the ARIA Charts.
In November 2021, they joined Australian-born, Canadian country artist Gord Bamford for the Australian version of his single "Drink Along Song" in 2021.[22]
The Wolfe Brothers were nominated for seven awards at the 2022 CMAAs, winning two.[23]
In April 2022, the Wolfe Brothers commenced their Startin' Something tour across Australia.[24]
The Wolfe Brothers' sixth studio album Livin' the Dream was released on 14 April 2023.[25] The album was written during the pandemic over Zoom writing sessions with writers all over the world. Nick Wolfe produced the album with Rod McCormack and Matt Fell. Nick said "Sonically, Livin' the Dream is a conscious decision by us to get back to our country roots. We explored a lot of pop and rock territory on our last record but we want to come out of the gate swinging country style and give everyone a taste of what's to come for the rest of this record that we're really proud of."
The Wolfe Brothers were nominated for six awards at the 2024 CMAAs.[26][27]
