Early life[edit]

Haun started acting when she was three, in a commercial for Little Caesars. Her first television appearance was on an episode of Anything But Love, and her first notable film role was as Mara, the ruthless leader of the sinister children in 1995's Village of the Damned.
Haun also starred in the Emmy-winning Disney Channel original movie, The Color of Friendship in 2000, which was based on a true story; from there she continued her relationship with Disney as one of the Movie Surfers. She later appeared in ABC Family's Brave New Girl, a television film based on the book co-written by Britney Spears.
In 2006, she starred in the movie Broken Bridges with Toby Keith, and was also signed to his record label, Show Dog Nashville, to be their first "cross-over" artist. Haun is also featured on the movie's soundtrack.
That year, Haun also co-starred in the movie Rome and Jewel, a movie based on William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, but set in Los Angeles and involving an interracial romance.
Haun is also a director of short films including a film which won Fearless Filmmaking Grand Prize in Slamdance Film Festival and another one starring Amanda Fuller.
