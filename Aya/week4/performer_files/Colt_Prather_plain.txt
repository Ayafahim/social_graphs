Colt Prather (born December 10, 1971, in El Paso, Texas[1]) is an American country music singer-songwriter. Prather was discovered playing with the house band at a Nashville restaurant and signed to Epic Records.[2] His third single for the label, "I Won't Go On and On," peaked at number 48 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in early 2004.[1] The song received a favorable review from Deborah Evans Price of Billboard, who said that "Prather is the owner of a voice that should easily separate him from the rest of the pack" and "success in the country format is surely forthcoming."[3] By June 2004, Prather had exited the label.[4]
