Jerry Jeff Walker (born Ronald Clyde Crosby; March 16, 1942 – October 23, 2020)[3][4] was an American country and folk singer-songwriter. He was a leading figure in the progressive country and  outlaw country music movement. He wrote the 1968 song "Mr. Bojangles".[5]


Early life[edit]
Walker was born Ronald Clyde Crosby in Oneonta, New York, on March 16, 1942.  His father, Mel, worked as a sports referee and bartender; his mother, Alma (Conrow), was a housewife.[6] His maternal grandparents played for square dances in the Oneonta area[6] – his grandmother, Jessie Conrow, playing piano, while his grandfather played fiddle. During the late 1950s, Crosby was a member of a local Oneonta teen band called The Tones.[7]
After high school, Crosby joined the National Guard, but his thirst for adventure led him to go AWOL and he was eventually discharged.[6][8]  He went on to roam the country busking for a living in New Orleans and throughout Texas, Florida, and New York, often accompanied by H. R. Stoneback (a friendship referenced in 1970's "Stoney").[9] He first played under the stage name of Jerry Ferris, then Jeff Walker, before amalgamating them into Jerry Jeff Walker and legally changing his name to that in the late 1960s.[8]

Career[edit]
Walker spent his early folk music days in Greenwich Village in the mid-1960s.[10] He co-founded a band with Bob Bruno in the late-1960s called Circus Maximus that put out two albums,[10] one with the popular FM radio hit "Wind", but Bruno's interest in jazz apparently diverged from Walker's interest in folk music.[10] Walker thus resumed his solo career and recorded the seminal 1968 album Mr. Bojangles with the help of David Bromberg and other influential Atlantic recording artists.[11][12]  He settled in Austin, Texas, in the 1970s, associating mainly with the outlaw country scene that included artists such as Michael Martin Murphey, Willie Nelson, Guy Clark, Waylon Jennings,[6] and Townes Van Zandt.[13]  "Jerry Jeff's train songs" were cited in the lyrics of Jennings and Nelson's 1977 hit song "Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)".[14] On September 28, 1974, Walker appeared with Doug Sahm at Carnegie Hall's Main Hall.
A string of records for MCA and Elektra followed Walker's move to Austin, Texas,[10] before he gave up on the mainstream music business and formed his own independent record label. Tried & True Music was founded in 1986,[15] with his wife Susan as president and manager.[16][17] Susan also founded Goodknight Music as his management company and Tried & True Artists for his bookings.[16] A series of increasingly autobiographical records followed under the Tried & True imprint, which also sells his autobiography, Gypsy Songman.[18]  In 2004, Walker released his first DVD of songs from his past performed in an intimate setting in Austin.[19]
Walker married Susan Streit in 1974 in Travis County, Texas.[4] They had two children: a son, Django Walker, who is also a musician, and a daughter Jessie Jane.[6] Walker had a retreat on Ambergris Caye in Belize, where he recorded his Cowboy Boots and Bathing Suits album in 1998.[20] He also made a guest appearance on Ramblin' Jack Elliott's 1998 album of duets Friends of Mine,[21] singing "He Was a Friend of Mine" and Woody Guthrie's "Hard Travelin'".[22][23]
Walker recorded songs written by others such as "LA Freeway" (Guy Clark), "Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother" (Ray Wylie Hubbard),[6] "(Looking for) The Heart of Saturday Night" (Tom Waits),[24] and "London Homesick Blues" (Gary P. Nunn).[6] He also interpreted the songs of others such as Rodney Crowell, Townes Van Zandt, Paul Siebel, Bob Dylan, Todd Snider, Dave Roberts, and even a rodeo clown named Billy Jim Baker. Walker was given the moniker of "the Jimmy Buffett of Texas".[25][26][27] It was Walker who first drove Jimmy Buffett to Key West (from Coconut Grove, Florida in a Packard).[28]  The two musicians also co-wrote the song "Railroad Lady" while riding the last run of the Panama Limited.[28][29]

"Mr. Bojangles"[edit]
Walker's "Mr. Bojangles" (1968) is perhaps his best-known and most-often performed song.[4] It is about an obscure alcoholic but talented tap-dancing drifter Walker had met who, when arrested and jailed in New Orleans, insisted on being identified only as "Bojangles".
Notable recordings of the song include a live version by his bandmate Bromberg on his album Demon in Disguise, a single by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band that charted at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1971 (also released on their album Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy). and its inclusion in medley on the 1974 debut self-titled album by Jim Stafford.

Later years and death[edit]
Walker had an annual birthday celebration in Austin at the Paramount Theatre and at Gruene Hall in Gruene, Texas.[4] The party brought some of the biggest names in country music out for a night of picking and swapping stories.[30]
He died from throat cancer on October 23, 2020, at a hospital in Austin, Texas at the age of 78.[6][31][32]
