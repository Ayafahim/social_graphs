Rick Vincent is an American country music artist. Signed to Curb Records in 1992, Vincent released his debut album, A Wanted Man, the following year and had two singles on the Billboard country chart. The album and its two singles remain Vincent's only contributions as a recording artist.
Vincent moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1989 to pursue his musical career. After songwriter and producer Wendy Waldman discovered one of his demo tapes, he signed to Curb Records in 1992.[3] His lone Curb album, A Wanted Man, charted two singles: "The Best Mistakes I Ever Made" and "Ain't Been a Train Through Here in Years".[2] The album received a positive review from Brian Mansfield of Allmusic, who said that Vincent "writes thoughtful and literate lyrics" while praising Vincent's singing voice.[4] Similarly, a review in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette praised Vincent's lyricism and influence from the Bakersfield sound, while also noting his "strong, rich baritone".[3] A third single from the album, "Hello, She Lied", did not chart,[5] and Vincent never recorded again. However, he co-wrote the song "Heartbroke Every Day", a top 20 country hit for Lonestar in 1996.[1]
