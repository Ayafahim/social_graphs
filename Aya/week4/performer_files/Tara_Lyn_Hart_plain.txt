Tara Lyn Hart (born April 11, 1978) is a Canadian country music singer/songwriter.


Biography[edit]
Hart won a music contest at the age of 17, which enabled her to record demos to be distributed to Canadian country radio. Chantal Kreviazuk's manager Danny Schur[1] passed her recordings to Sony Music Canada's Mike Roth, which led to a recording contract with Epic Records on the eve of her 18th birthday and two weeks before her wedding.[2]
In 1998, Hart was named Billboard magazine's "Most Likely to Succeed".[3] Her self-titled debut album was released on October 5, 1999.  At the 2000 Juno Awards, she was nominated for Best Country Female Artist and the all-genre Best New Solo Artist.[4] In April 2000, she was invited to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. 
Hart won three awards at the 2000 Manitoba Association of Country Arts Awards for Female Vocalist, Song of the Year, and Video of the Year for "Stuff That Matters." On June 9, 2000, she won two awards at RPM's Big Country Awards for Outstanding New Female Artist and Canadian Country Video of the Year for "Stuff That Matters." 
She was nominated for six awards at the 2000 Canadian Country Music Association (CCMA) Awards, won the FACTOR Rising Star Award at the September 11, 2000, ceremony, and picked up two more nominations at the 2000 Prairie Music Awards for Outstanding Country Recording and Outstanding Album by a Major Label. 
At the 2001 Juno Awards, Hart was again nominated for Best Country Female Artist. She also picked up a nomination for Female Vocalist of the Year at the 2001 CCMA Awards, competing against Lisa Brokop, Terri Clark, Carolyn Dawn Johnson and Michelle Wright.
She began work on her second album in June 2003, and the first single, "Happiness," was released in September. Before the album was finished, Hart abandoned the project to spend more time with her husband and their three children.[5]
She began work on a musical comedy, "Miss Kitty's Holiday Extravaganza," which ran from October to December 2004. In November 2010 she released a six-song Christmas EP, Perfect Holiday.
