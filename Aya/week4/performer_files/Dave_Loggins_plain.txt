David Allen Loggins (November 10, 1947 – July 10, 2024) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician. He is best known for his 1974 hit single "Please Come to Boston" as well as his 1984 duet with Anne Murray, "Nobody Loves Me Like You Do".


Musical career[edit]
Loggins wrote his 1974 song composition "Please Come to Boston", which was a No. 5 on the pop chart (No. 1 on the Easy Listening chart) in the U.S.[1] 
He also wrote the song "Pieces of April" for the band Three Dog Night, which was a top 20 success in 1973.[citation needed] He had written songs for Jimmy Buffett (Buffett's "Come Monday" was bumped from the charts by "Please Come to Boston" in late July 1974), Tanya Tucker, Restless Heart, Wynonna Judd, Reba McEntire, Gary Morris, Billy Ray Cyrus, Alabama, Toby Keith, Don Williams, and Crystal Gayle. Loggins wrote the number one hits "Morning Desire" by Kenny Rogers and "You Make Me Want To Make You Mine" by Juice Newton.[citation needed]
During 1984, he recorded "Nobody Loves Me Like You Do," a duet with Anne Murray, which scored number one on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. Loggins and Murray were named Vocal Duo of the Year at the CMA Awards during 1985.[2] One of Loggins' most famous musical compositions is "Augusta," which he wrote while visiting the Augusta National Golf Club in 1981. The next year, CBS began using the song at the Masters Golf Tournament as the theme song for its coverage each year.[3] In 1982, David Lasley released a cover version of Loggins’ “If I Had My Wish Tonight”, originally released by Loggins in 1979.[4]
In 1995, Loggins was inducted to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.[5]

Personal life and death[edit]
David Allen Loggins was born on November 10, 1947 in Mountain City, Tennessee. Before becoming a musician, Loggins was employed as a draftsman and as an insurance salesman.[5]
His second cousin, Kenny Loggins, is also a singer-songwriter.[6]
Loggins died in Nashville on July 10, 2024, at the age of 76.[7][8][9]
