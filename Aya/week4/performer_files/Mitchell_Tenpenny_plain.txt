According to Tenpenny, when he was 11, his grandmother introduced to him songwriters Bobby Braddock and Curly Putman and he became interested in songwriting.[2]  He grew up listening to country, rock, and R&B, and cited Vince Gill, John Mayer, and Michael Jackson among his musical influences.[3]  He attended Lipscomb Academy in Nashville where he played football. He then enrolled at Middle Tennessee State University where he originally intended to play college football, but became more interested being in a band.[4] He graduated with a music business degree.[5]

Tenpenny released his debut album, titled Black Crow, in 2015. A track, "Canes Creek", featured the bluegrass band The SteelDrivers.[3]  His debut single was the title track of the album, "Black Crow".[6] In his early songwriting career, he wrote a number of songs with artists such as Nick Fradiani;[7] an early success is the Top 10 song he co-wrote "If the Boot Fits", recorded by Granger Smith.[8]  He signed a publishing deal with Sony ATV Music Publishing Nashville,[5] and was involved in the documentary film The Voyage in 2014.[9] He was signed to a newly formed Riser Records in 2016.[10]
In July 2017, Tenpenny released an EP, Linden Ave, named after the street where his grandmother Donna Hilley used to live.[11] The EP charted at No. 10 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart, No. 6 in Heatseekers Albums, and No. 12 in Country Album Sales, with 2,100 copies sold in its first week.[12][13]
In January 2018, Tenpenny entered into a joint venture with Riser House/Columbia Nashville and released a self-titled EP on February 23, featuring a new single "Drunk Me".[14]
