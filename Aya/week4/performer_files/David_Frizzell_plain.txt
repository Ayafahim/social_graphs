David Frizzell (born September 26, 1941)[1] is an American country music singer. He is the younger brother of country musician, Lefty Frizzell.[2] His career started in the late 1950s, but his biggest success came in the 1980s.


Biography[edit]
Frizzell was born in El Dorado, Arkansas, United States.[2] He began performing in his brother's show at the age of 12.[2] He toured with his brother throughout the 1950s and 1960s and served in the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War.[2] He signed with Columbia Records in 1970 and finally achieved solo success, placing the single "I Just Can't Help Believing" on the Billboard top-40 country chart.[2]
Frizzell appeared regularly on Buck Owens' All American TV Show during the 1970s, and recorded for Capitol Records.[2] In 1981, he recorded his first number-one country hit, "You're the Reason God Made Oklahoma," a duet with Shelly West.[2] The song won the Country Music Association's Song of the Year and Vocal Duet of the Year awards in 1981, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and was featured in Clint Eastwood's film Any Which Way You Can.[2] Frizzell and West also won the Academy of Country Music award for Vocal Duo of the Year in 1981 and 1982.[2]
In August 1982, Frizzell scored his only solo number-one country single with "I'm Gonna Hire a Wino to Decorate Our Home".[2] He continued to tour and record with West until 1986.[2]
After he parted ways with Shelly West, Frizzell continued to record solo albums, but he has not kept up the popularity he enjoyed during the early 1980s.[2] Notwithstanding, he continues to record and tour.
