Dean Brody (born August 12, 1975) is a Canadian country music artist from British Columbia.[2] He has won 16 CCMA Awards and 2 JUNO Awards.[3]
Originally signed to Broken Bow Records in 2008, Brody made his debut later that year with the single "Brothers". This song, a Top 40 country hit in the US, was the first single from his self-titled debut album, released in 2009 under the production of Matt Rovey. In 2010, Brody was signed to Open Road Recordings and released his second album, Trail in Life. In 2012, he released his third album, Dirt, earning the 2012 CCMA Album of the Year award and a 2013 Juno nomination for Country Album of the Year. Brody also won the 2012 and 2013 CCMA Male Artist of the Year award. Brody's fourth album, Crop Circles, was released in 2013. Brody's fifth album, Gypsy Road, was released in 2015. Brody's sixth album, Beautiful Freakshow, was released in 2016, and he subsequently earned the singer 3 Awards at the 2017 CCMA Awards show, including Fan's Choice, Songwriter of the Year and Top-Selling Canadian Single of the Year for "Bush Party".[4] In 2020, Brody landed the record for the most played song ever in a single week at Canadian country radio with "Canadian Summer", which was included on his seventh album Boys.[5] He is the only Canadian country artist to have headlined the Budweiser Stage in Toronto for six consecutive years.[6]


Biography[edit]
Dean Brody was born in Smithers, British Columbia and grew up in Jaffray, British Columbia. As a boy, Brody worked at a sawmill, also playing guitar in his spare time. By 2004, he had moved to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue his musical career. Although he found a songwriting contract, the expiration of his US work permit forced him to move back to Canada. Eventually, he returned to Nashville through the suggestion of producer Keith Stegall, who helped him sign with Broken Bow Records in 2008.[7] Brody released his debut single, "Brothers", late that year. Shortly before its release, Brody was injured in a waterskiing accident on the Potomac River and had to undergo extensive reconstructive surgery.[8][9] Brody lived in Windsor, Nova Scotia and Chester, Nova Scotia from 2010 to 2017.[10][11][12] In 2020, he launched his own beer, "Hucklejack Canadian Lager".[13] Brody has run the "Dean Brody Foundation", which supports global initiatives, since the early 2010s.[14]
