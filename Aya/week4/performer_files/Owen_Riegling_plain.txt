Owen Michael Riegling is a Canadian country music singer and songwriter. He is currently signed to Universal Music Canada, and has charted with the singles "Love (The Sweater Song)", "Old Dirt Roads", and "Moonshines".[1][2]


Early life[edit]
Riegling grew up on a 100-acre farm in Mildmay, Ontario.[3] He began playing the guitar at eleven years old, after receiving one as a Christmas gift.[4] He performed for the first time as part of his guitar teacher's band (Country Indie Artist Tattoos 'N Whiskey), before progressing to play covers of Eric Church songs at local venues.[4] Riegling initially attended business school after high school, but realized he enjoyed playing music more. He elected to attend the Ontario Institute of Audio Recording Technology for music production, after he had won a free recording session in a contest.[4]

Career[edit]
In July 2019, Riegling independently released the song "Smoke Man".[4] The song was included on his debut extended play Empty Room, which was released on September 4, 2020.[5] In August 2022, Riegling won the Boots and Hearts Emerging Artist Showcase contest, securing him a single release with Universal Music Canada, songwriting sessions, and a trip to Nashville.[6][7][8]
In June 2023, Riegling signed a record deal with Universal Music Canada and released his debut radio single "Love (The Sweater Song)".[1][9] He was also nominated for "Rising Star" at the CMA Ontario Awards.[10] In August 2023, Riegling released the song "Old Dirt Roads", which later became his second single at Canadian country radio.[11][12][13] In October 2023, he was an opening act for American country artist Tyler Hubbard on his solo headlining tour in Canada.[1][14] Later that fall, Riegling joined Robyn Ottolini as the opening act for the Canadian dates on her "All My Friends Are Hot Tour".[15] In 2024, he joined Chase Rice's "Get Western Tour" as an opening act for most of the Canadian dates.[16] On May 24, 2024, Riegling released the extended play Bruce County.[17] He was nominated in four categories at the 2024 Canadian Country Music Awards, and won Breakthrough Artist of the Year and Songwriter of the Year.[18][19][20]
