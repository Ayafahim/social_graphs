S-K-O, originally known as Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, was an American country music vocal group consisting of Thom Schuyler, J. Fred Knobloch, and Paul Overstreet.[1] The original line-up recorded one album for MTM Records and charted three country hits, including the number one "Baby's Got a New Baby".[1] After Overstreet departed in 1987 for a solo career, he was replaced with Craig Bickhardt, and the group was renamed Schuyler, Knobloch, and Bickhardt, or S-K-B for short.[1] The renamed group released one album and four singles before disbanding in 1989.[1]


Biography[edit]
Thom Schuyler, J. Fred Knobloch, and Paul Overstreet were three Nashville, Tennessee-based songwriters who got together to form the group in 1986.[1] After the release of their first single, they shortened their name simply to S-K-O.[2] When Overstreet left the group in 1987 to pursue a solo career, he was replaced by Craig Bickhardt and they changed their name to Schuyler, Knobloch & Bickhardt or S-K-B for short.[1] S-K-B disbanded when their record label, MTM Records, shut down in 1989.[3] Since then, Thom Schuyler became the vice president of RCA Nashville (a position from which he retired in 1994), while Knobloch and Bickhardt continued their songwriting careers.[1]
