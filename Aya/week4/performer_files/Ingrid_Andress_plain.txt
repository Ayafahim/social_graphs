Ingrid Elizabeth Andress (born September 21, 1991) is an American country music singer-songwriter. Her breakthrough single, "More Hearts Than Mine" (2019) peaked at number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100. Her single "The Stranger" (2020) peaked at number 49 on Country Airplay and her single "Wishful Drinking" (2021) became her second entry on the Billboard Hot 100.  She has released two albums: Lady Like (2020) and Good Person (2022). She has also cowritten songs recorded by other artists including "Boys" (2017) by Charli XCX.


Early life[edit]
Andress was born in Southfield, Michigan,[1] and grew up in Highlands Ranch, Colorado. She has three sisters and a brother and was mostly homeschooled until high school. Her father is former major league strength and conditioning coach Brad Andress, who worked for the  Detroit Tigers, Colorado Rockies, and New York Mets.[3] As a child, she learned to play piano and drums. In middle school, she frequently listened to Coldplay and Evanescence and she started a heavy metal music band.[4] She attended Rock Canyon High School, where she participated in high school choir competitions.

Career[edit]
Education and early career[edit]
Andress attended Berklee College of Music and majored in songwriting and performance.[5][6] She joined a cappella group Pitch Slapped and performed on the NBC singing competition The Sing-Off. Andress later joined the group Delilah and placed sixth. After leaving the show, Andress finished her degree in 2013 and underwent mentorship with her former teacher at Berklee and pop songwriter Kara DioGuardi. She then moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and signed a publishing deal with Sea Gayle Music and Arthouse Entertainment in 2014.[2] From there, she began co-writing songs for other artists: "Boys" (2017), recorded by Charli XCX; "In Too Deep", recorded by Why Don't We, "Conflicted" (2018) recorded by Halestorm; "Girl in the Mirror" (2019) recorded by Bebe Rexha; and several songs on the No Saint (2019) album by Lauren Jenkins.[7]

2018–2020: Breakthrough with Lady Like[edit]
Andress signed a recording contract with Warner Nashville and Atlantic Records in July 2018.[8] In February 2019, her first song with the label, "Lady Like", was released to digital platforms and was a top ten debut on Top Country Albums.[9]
In April 2019, she released the single "More Hearts Than Mine", which reached the top five of the American and Canadian country airplay charts.[9][10]  On March 27, 2020, she released her debut studio album Lady Like through Warner Music Nashville.[11] In April 2020, Andress reached No. 1 on the Billboard Emerging Artists chart.[9] The album became one of Billboard's Top 10 Best Country Albums of the year and set the record as the highest streaming country female debut album of all time upon release.[12]
In July 2020, she released "The Stranger", which peaked at number 49 on Country Airplay. The deluxe edition of Lady Like was released on October 2, 2020.[13] At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, Andress received three Grammy Awards nominations: Best Country Song ("More Hearts Than Mine"), Best Country Album (Lady Like), and Best New Artist; these nominations made her the only country artist in a "Big Four" category.[14]

2021–present: Good Person[edit]
In August 2021, Andress released "Wishful Drinking", a collaboration with Sam Hunt. The song peaked at number 4 on Country Airplay. The song, though originally not intended for the album, was included as a bonus track and served as the lead single to her sophomore album Good Person.[15] "Wishful Drinking" earned Andress her 4th Grammy Award nomination, for Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 65th annual ceremony.
Two more singles were released from the album; "Seeing Someone Else", which became her first cross-format single and peaked top 25 on the Adult Pop Airplay chart, and "Feel Like This", the album's second country single. The album charted on both the Billboard 200 and the Top Country Albums chart.[16][17]

Personal life[edit]
Andress resides in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Andress broke up with her boyfriend of six years and entered a new relationship.[18]
On July 15, 2024, Andress performed the "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the 2024 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby.[19] The performance received criticism online; Tomás Mier of Rolling Stone referred to it as a "flub" while Jim Reineking of USA Today labeled it as "cringeworthy".[19][20] On July 16, 2024, Andress claimed she was intoxicated during the performance and that she planned to check into a rehab facility.[21]
