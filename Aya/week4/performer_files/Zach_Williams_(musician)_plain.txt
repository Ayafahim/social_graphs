Zachary Stephen Williams was born in Pensacola, Florida on June 27, 1978 but grew up in Jonesboro, Arkansas.[1]

Music career[edit]
Zach Williams & The Reformation[edit]
He was the lead singer in Zach Williams & The Reformation,[2] an American rock band formed in Jonesboro, Arkansas in 2007 by the group of Zach Williams (acoustic guitar, harmonica and vocals), Red Dorton (bass guitar and vocals), Robby Rigsbee (slide guitar and rhythm guitar), Josh Copeland (lead guitar, rhythm guitar and vocals) and Evan Wilons (drums). The band took their name from the desire to reform or revitalize the southern rock sound. The band released two independent albums, Electric Revival in 2009 and A Southern Offering in 2011. In 2012, Williams disbanded the Reformation due to his newfound Christian beliefs.

The Brothers of Grace / Zach Williams and the Brothers of Grace[edit]
After Zach Williams and the Reformation disbanded, Williams and guitarist Robby Rigsbee dedicated their lives to Christ and began playing music in their church. Church band the Brothers of Grace became Zach Williams and the Brothers of Grace. Shaun Kirby, who had previously been part of southern rock band Further Down with Rigsbee, was the drummer. The group also included Bruce Ford (bass) and Kevin Rouse (keyboard). They independently released an EP, "Shine a Light", in 2014.

Solo career[edit]
In 2016 Williams signed to Provident Label Group - Essential Records as a solo artist,[3] four years after Zach Williams & The Reformation disbanded.  He released his first solo single, "Chain Breaker" in 2016[4] which reached No. 1 on the Hot Christian Songs Chart and the Top 10 on Christian radio.[5] Following the single, Williams released a five-song EP, Chain Breaker, with producers Jonathan Smith and Colby Wedgeworth.[citation needed] Williams also formerly led worship at the Refuge Campus of Central Baptist Church in Jonesboro, Arkansas, where he was  on staff from 2014 to 2017.[6]
On December 14, 2016, Williams digitally released his full-length album, Chain Breaker, and announced a release date of January 27, 2017 for the CD.[7]
On October 4, 2019, Williams released his second album, Rescue Story. It includes the single, "There Was Jesus", with Dolly Parton.
On September 30, 2022, Williams released his third album. A Hundred Highways. It includes the single, "Heart of God". His song "Up There, Down Here", from the same album, was covered by contestant Warren Peay on season 21 of American Idol.[relevant?]
