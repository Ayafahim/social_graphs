Honeyhoney (stylized as honeyhoney) was an Americana group based in Los Angeles, California, United States.


History[edit]
The band was formed in 2006 by musician Benjamin Jaffe and musician/model/actress Suzanne Santo.  The two met at a costume party and signed a record deal a year later.[1]  They originally performed under the name Zanzibar Lewis and were under that name when they signed with the now-defunct Ironworks record label.[2]
Their debut album, First Rodeo, was released by Ironworks on November 4.[2]  Ironworks co-owner Kiefer Sutherland directed and starred in the group's music video for their song "Little Toy Gun".[3]  Honeyhoney toured with Lifehouse, another Ironworks band, at the start of their career.[4]  The band released their second studio album, Billy Jack, on Oct 24, 2011 under their own honeyhoney Records/Lost Highway label.[5]
Their third album, 3, was produced by Dave Cobb and released June 9, 2015.[6]  The website American Songwriter reviewed it writing, "with a singer-songwriter that exudes the magnetic passion and swaggering star power of Santo, this is a group whose time has come."[7]
The duo parted with Rounder and disbanded in 2017.[8][9]

Style[edit]
Paste Magazine describes honeyhoney's style as "display[ing] the common pop thread between alt.country, spaghetti western soundtracks and swampy blues."[1]
Glide Magazine stated that "honeyhoney deftly mixes elements of folk, soul, country, pop, and rock."[10]

Outreach[edit]
In April 2014, the band traveled to Williamstown, Massachusetts, where Jaffe was raised, to perform a concert on behalf of local music programs.  The band is planning a similar concert for schools in Santo's hometown of Cleveland, Ohio.[11]
