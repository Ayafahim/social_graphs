Early life and music career[edit]
Buddy was born in Fairborn, Ohio, near Dayton, and his family ended up settling in Princeton, New Jersey.[2][1] His grandfather gave him the nickname "Buddy."[3]
During the late 1970s he was in a country-rock band called the Desperate Men, which played in the NNJ and New York area, including clubs like Stanhope House, Cuss From Hoe and others.[citation needed] In 1975, he moved to Austin, Texas and played rockabilly music in Ray Campi's band. He auditioned for and played in the band Partners In Crime with Julie Griffin (soon to be his second wife).[2][4]
In 1980, they moved to New York City, and Miller formed the Buddy Miller Band,[5] which included singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin on vocals and guitar. He also performed with Jim Lauderdale and Larry Campbell.[4] Each Sunday, Miller performed in Kinky Friedman's band at the Lone Star Cafe.[6]
