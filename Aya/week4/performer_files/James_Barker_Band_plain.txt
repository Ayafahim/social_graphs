The band consists of James Barker, Taylor Abram, Connor Stephen, and Bobby Martin.[1] In Canada, they have four number one country singles with "Chills", "Keep It Simple", "Over All Over Again", and "New Old Trucks".


Career[edit]
In 2015, they won the Emerging Artist Showcase at the Boots and Hearts Music Festival and the following year, they were signed to Universal Music Canada.[2] The band's debut extended play, Game On, was released April 21, 2017.[3] The band received two Juno Award nominations for Breakthrough Group of the Year and Country Album of the Year at the 2018 Juno Awards,[4] winning the second.[5] In 2018, the band's song "Chills", cowritten by Barker, Gavin Slate, Travis Wood and Donovan Woods, received a SOCAN Songwriting Prize nomination[6] and won the award for Single of the Year at the Canadian Country Music Awards.[7][8]
The band became the first artist to record a globally released Spotify Singles session in Canada in November 2018.[9][10] Their second extended play, Singles Only, was released May 24, 2019.[11] They would follow that up with the standalone single "Summer Time" in June 2020,[12] and the extended play JBB-Sides in August 2020.[13]
In May 2021, they signed a record deal with Sony Music Nashville and Villa 40, and released the single "Over All Over Again",[14][15] which became their third Canada Country number one.[16] In October 2021, they released the song "New Old Trucks", which features American country singer Dierks Bentley.[17] They followed that up with "Wastin' Whiskey" in 2022 on Starseed Records.[18] In the spring and summer of 2022, the band joined Dallas Smith as opening acts on his headlining "Some Things Never Change Tour" across Canada.[19] In January 2023, the band signed with Records Nashville, a joint venture between Sony Music Entertainment and Barry Weiss, and released the single "Meet Your Mama".[20] They would follow that up with the single "On the Water" featuring American country artist Dalton Dover in May of 2023.[21] Both songs are included on their extended play Ahead of Our Time, which was released on October 20, 2023.[22]
