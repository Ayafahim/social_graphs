Biography[edit]
Josh Logan was born in Cartersville, Kentucky. As a teenager, he was taught guitar chords by his cousin.[1] For twelve years, Logan worked at an auto salvage yard, performing nightly at local bars.[1][2] Logan's musical inspirations were George Jones, Merle Haggard, and Mel Street, to whom he has been compared in vocal styling.[1][3]
Eventually, Logan was signed to Curb Records, releasing his debut single "I Made You a Woman for Somebody Else", which was withdrawn when Conway Twitty recorded it.[3] By 1988, Logan had released his first album Somebody Paints the Wall. This album produced three chart singles, the highest-charting being "Every Time I Get to Dreamin'", which spent nine weeks on the Billboard Hot Country Singles (now Hot Country Songs) charts and peaked at No. 58.[2] Both it and its follow-up, "Somebody Paints the Wall", reached Top 40 on the Cash Box country charts as well.[1] The latter song was also a Top 10 for Tracy Lawrence in 1992.
The album's success led to tours with Garth Brooks and Earl Thomas Conley. The third and final single, "I Was Born with a Broken Heart", was co-written by Aaron Tippin, whose own version was later released as a single from his 1992 album Read Between the Lines. David Ball also recorded the song on his 1989 self-titled debut, although this album was not released until 1994. Logan left Curb in the early 1990s, then he released an album called Something Strange in Europe in 1995.[3] This album produced multiple singles on the European country singles charts, including two top-20 hits.[1]
Logan was honored in 2002 with a display at the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame in Renfro Valley, Kentucky. One year later, he released his third album, Cartersville, Kentucky Country Boy,[1] followed by I Am What I Am in 2009.
