Billy Ray Hoffman is an American country music singer and songwriter. He released one album, All I Wanted Was You, in 2000. This album charted the singles "Perfect Night" and "You're the Ticket".


Biography[edit]
Billy Ray Hoffman was born in Arkansas and raised in Poteau, Oklahoma.[2] He was born with a hearing problem and is only three percent away from being deaf. He also learned to play guitar to gain dexterity after being born with underdeveloped hands.[3]
In 2000, he was the first artist signed to Critter Records, which was managed by Joe Stampley.[4] Stampley produced Hoffman's debut album, which included a cover of Paul Davis' "I Go Crazy."[5] Two singles from the album charted on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.[6] The album received a mixed review from Ray Waddell of Billboard, who wrote that "while lacking the vocal gymnastics heard in much of what populates current country radio, Hoffman's easygoing style mostly serves this material well."[7] Hoffman retired from the music business after his first album and moved back to Poteau to focus on various business ventures.[1]
