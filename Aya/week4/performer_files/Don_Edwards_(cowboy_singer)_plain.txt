Notes[edit]


^ a b The Santa Clarita Valley Signal reports that Edward's age when he died on October 23, 2022 as 86,[3] which would put his birth year as 1935 or 1936. However, AllMusic reports Edward's date of birth as March 20, 1939.[2] The use of AllMusic for biographical details is not fully supported by Wikipedia editors (see WP:RSP), so it is not being used in this article to verify his date of birth unless subsequent reports clarify his birth date. AllMusic is, however, being used to verify his place of birth.
