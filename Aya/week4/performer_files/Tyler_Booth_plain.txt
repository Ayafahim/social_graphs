Background[edit]
Born December 15, 1996, Booth was raised in Campton, Kentucky Wolfe County, Kentucky, which is in the Eastern part of the state. He grew up listening to Black Label Society, Five Finger Death Punch, Waylon Jennings and his father Jason's rock band Stitch Rivet, a regional rock band fronted by Booth's uncle Gene, twin brother of father Jason, who also managed the band.[1] He was accepted into Morehead State University on a music scholarship and an instructor in the music department, Scott Miller, became an early advocate for Booth's talents.
