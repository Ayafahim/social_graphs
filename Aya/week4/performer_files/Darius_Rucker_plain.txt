Darius Carlos Rucker (born May 13, 1966)[3] is an American singer, musician, and songwriter. He first gained fame as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of rock band Hootie & the Blowfish, which he founded in 1986 at the University of South Carolina along with Mark Bryan, Jim "Soni" Sonefeld, and Dean Felber. The band released five studio albums with Rucker as a member and charted six top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. Rucker co-wrote most of the songs with the other members of the band.
His debut studio album, an R&B record titled Back to Then (2002) was released through Hidden Beach Recordings. Six years later, Rucker signed to Capitol Nashville as a country singer and released his second album, Learn to Live (2008). Its first single, "Don't Think I Don't Think About It", peaked at number one on Hot Country Songs chart, making it the first song by a Black artist to do so since Charley Pride in 1983. It was followed by three similarly successful singles: "It Won't Be Like This for Long", "Alright", and "History in the Making".
In 2009, he became the first Black American to win the New Artist Award from the Country Music Association, and the second Black person to win any award from the association. His third album, Charleston, SC 1966, was released on October 12, 2010. The album included the number one country singles, "Come Back Song" and "This". His fourth album, True Believers (2013), reached number 2 on the Billboard 200, and spawned the singles "True Believers", "Wagon Wheel", and "Radio". His first country Christmas album, Home for the Holidays (2014) reached number 31 on the US Billboard 200. His sixth album, Southern Style (2014) reached number 6 on the Billboard 200, supported by the singles "Homegrown Honey" and "Southern Style". His seventh and eighth studio albums, When Was the Last Time (2017) and Carolyn's Boy (2023) followed thereafter.


Early life[edit]
Rucker was born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina.[4] His single mother, Carolyn, a nurse at Medical University of South Carolina, raised him with his three sisters and two brothers.[5] According to Rucker, his father was never around, and Rucker saw him only before church on Sundays.[6] His father was in a gospel band called The Traveling Echoes.[6] Rucker has said that he had a typical Southern African-American upbringing.[4] His family attended church every Sunday and was economically poor, and at one point, his mother, her two sisters, his grandmother and 14 children were all living in a three-bedroom house.[4] But he says that he looks back on his childhood with very fond memories.[4] His sister, L'Corine, recalled that singing was always his dream.[4]

Hootie & the Blowfish[edit]
Darius Rucker has been the lead singer of Hootie & the Blowfish since its formation in 1986. He met fellow band members Mark Bryan, Jim "Soni" Sonefeld,[4] and Dean Felber while attending the University of South Carolina. Bryan first heard Rucker singing in the shower, and the two became a duo, playing R.E.M. covers at a local venue.[7] They later recruited Felber and finally Sonefeld joined in 1989.[7] As a member of Hootie & the Blowfish, Rucker has recorded seven studio albums: Cracked Rear View – 1994, Fairweather Johnson – 1996, Musical Chairs – 1998, Scattered, Smothered & Covered – 2000, Hootie & the Blowfish - 2003, Looking for Lucky – 2005 and Imperfect Circle - 2019, also charting within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 six times.[8] All six albums feature songs that Rucker, Bryan, Felber, and Sonefeld wrote. As the frontman, Rucker began to be called simply "Hootie" by fans,[9] though the band title combines the nicknames of his college friends.[5] Before his rise to fame, he lived in the basement of the Sigma Phi Epsilon house at the University of South Carolina, attempting to launch his career through the college bar scene.
Rucker's signature contribution to the band is his baritone voice, which Rolling Stone has called "ingratiating,"[10] TIME has called "low, gruff, [and] charismatic,"[6] and Entertainment Weekly has characterized as a "barrelhouse growl."[11] Rucker said they "flipped" the formula of the all black band with a white frontman, like Frank Sinatra performing with Count Basie.[9] Musically, he has sometimes been criticized or spoofed for not being "black enough".[7] Saturday Night Live ran a sketch of Tim Meadows playing Rucker leading beer-drinking, white fraternity members in a counter-march to Louis Farrakhan's Million Man March.[6][12] He also received death threats for singing the Hootie song "Drowning," a protest song against the flying of the Confederate flag above the South Carolina statehouse.[6]
Shortly after gaining a measure of fame, Felber and Rucker (who consider themselves best friends) moved into an apartment in Columbia, South Carolina.[7] With Rucker's recognition as the frontman of a successful band came increased opportunities. In October 1995, he was asked to sing the national anthem at the World Series.[12] Frank Sinatra invited him to sing at his 80th birthday party; he sang "The Lady Is a Tramp."[13] That same week, he made a voice cameo in an episode of the sitcom Friends.[12] He also joined Nanci Griffith on the song "Gulf Coast Highway" for her 1997 album Blue Roses from the Moons,[14] and sang backing vocals on Radney Foster's 1999 album See What You Want to See.[15] He encouraged Atlantic Records to agree to a deal with Edwin McCain and made a guest appearance on McCain's debut album, Honor Among Thieves.[16]
In regard to the future of Hootie & the Blowfish, Rucker was quoted by CBS news as stating in late 2011, "I don't think we'll ever break up totally. We're Hootie & the Blowfish. ... We'll make another record and do another tour someday. I don't know when, but it will happen. There's one more in us."[17] After a ten-year hiatus, Rucker and the band announced that they would be touring with Barenaked Ladies in 2019 while also releasing a new album that same year.[18]
Their sixth studio album Imperfect Circle was released on November 1, 2019.[19]

Solo career[edit]
Rucker at Yokota Air Base in Japan, May 2004
In 2001, he made his solo R&B debut album, The Return of Mongo Slade, for Atlantic Records. Because of contractual changes, it was never released by the label.[20] Hidden Beach Recordings, an independent label, acquired the masters from Atlantic and released the album as Back to Then in July 2002.[20] The album included work from the production team of Jill Scott, and she made an appearance on the track "Sometimes I Wonder."[21] The single "This Is My World" was featured in the 2001 comedy film Shallow Hal. In regards to the album, "That was just a minute in my life," he later told The Arizona Republic about the record. "I was listening to a lot of Notorious B.I.G. and Lauryn Hill at that time, and I wanted to make a neo soul record."[22] He also said in the article that he doesn't anticipate recording an R&B-styled disc again. "Country music is my day job now. I'll probably do this till it's all over, but that album was a lot of fun."[22]
Rucker appeared on a pop-star edition of the quiz show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? in July 2001.[23] He also portrayed a singing cowboy in a television commercial for the fast-food company Burger King, promoting its TenderCrisp Bacon Cheddar Ranch sandwich in 2005. In the commercial, he sang a jingle set to the tune of "The Big Rock Candy Mountains".[24] In 2006 Rucker lent his voice to the track "God's Reasons" written by Dean Dinning and Joel A. Miller for the film The Still Life.

Country music[edit]
2008–2009: Learn to Live[edit]
In early 2008, Rucker signed to Capitol Records Nashville as the beginning of a career in country music. His first solo single, "Don't Think I Don't Think About It" (which he co-wrote with Clay Mills) debuted at No. 51 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts for the week of May 3, 2008. It is the first single from his second album, Learn to Live. For this album, Rucker worked with Frank Rogers, a record producer who has also produced for Brad Paisley and Trace Adkins.[25] Rucker also made his Grand Ole Opry debut in July 2008.[26][27] The single reached number one in September,[28] making Rucker the first solo, African-American artist to chart a number one country hit since Charley Pride's "Night Games" in 1983.[29]

Rucker sings to a crowd during an Operation Pacific Greetings tour concert.
Learn to Live was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 6, 2009, and received a platinum certification on August 7, 2009.[30] The album's second single, "It Won't Be Like This for Long", spent three weeks at the top of the country chart in mid-2009. Its follow-up, "Alright", became Rucker's third straight No. 1 hit, making him the first singer to have his first three country singles reach No. 1 since Wynonna in 1992.[31] The album's fourth single, "History in the Making" was released in September and peaked at No. 3.[32] The singles also crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at 35, 36, 30 and 61.[33]



"You see a lot of people doing a one-off, saying, 'This is my country record.' But this is a career I'm trying to build. The people that say that they don't get it, I'll let the music speak for itself. I plan to do a lot of country records."[34]


—Rucker, Billboard, 2008

Billboard magazine said that "there's a sense of purpose that makes Rucker feel like a member of the country family, rather than calculating interloper."[35] Rucker made visits to various country stations around the United States, explaining that he was aware that he was the "new kid on the block."[36] Mike Culotta, the program director of Tampa, Florida, radio station WQYK-FM expected that Rucker would be "somebody who would have entitlement," but instead said that "Darius engaged everybody."[37] When Rucker found that "Don't Think I Don't Think About It" went to number one, he cried.[38] On November 11, 2009, Rucker won the Country Music Association New Artist of the Year award (formerly known as the Horizon Award), making him the first African American to do so since the award was introduced in 1981.[39] Only one other African American has won at the CMAs: Charley Pride, who won entertainer of the year in 1971 and male vocalist in 1971 and 1972.[40]

2010–2011: Charleston, SC 1966[edit]

"I Got Nothin'" was the album's third single, peaking at No. 18.

He added that he was planning to reduce his performance commitments from 100 dates per year to about 30, and that he thought his experience in the entertainment business would be an asset to potential clients. Rucker will be able to work without restrictions for golfers, but because he is not registered with the NFL players' union, he initially will only be able to meet with NFL players under very limited circumstances.[66]
Rucker has hosted the Darius Rucker Intercollegiate at Long Cove Club in Hilton Head since 2012.[67] The three-day tournament annually hosts some of the top women's intercollegiate golf teams in the country.[68]
