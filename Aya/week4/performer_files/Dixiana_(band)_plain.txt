Dixiana was an American country music band. Founded in 1986, the band was composed of five members: brothers Mark (bass guitar, vocals) and Phil Lister (guitar, vocals), Randall Griffith (keyboards), Colonel Shuford (drums), and Cindy Murphy (lead vocals).[1]
Signed to Epic Records in 1992, they released their self-titled debut album that year.[2] It produced three singles, two of which charted on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts. The album received a C− rating from Entertainment Weekly, who described it as "generic country-pop" but highlighted lead vocalist Murphy as a "strong suit".[2] A fourth single, "Now You're Talkin'", was released in 1993. Joseph Stanley of Cash Box praised it as a "fresh and fun cut".[3]
Mark and Phil Lister have since co-founded a recording studio called Dixiana Music.[4]
