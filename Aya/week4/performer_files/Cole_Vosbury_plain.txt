"Most of the time I consider myself to be an abstract artist and I think of my music as paintings. When I make a song I'm painting a picture with sound." - Cole Vosbury


The Voice[edit]
On the second episode of the Blind Auditions broadcast on September 24, 2013, he performed The Jeffersons theme song, "Movin' On Up." Only Cee Lo Green turned his chair, thus he defaulted to Team CeeLo.[2]

In Knockout Round, Vosbury lost his battle, he was stolen by Blake.
