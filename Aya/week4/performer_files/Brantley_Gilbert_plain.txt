In July 2024, Gilbert announced his seventh studio album Tattoos, which was released on September 13, 2024.[26] He released the songs "Me and My House", featuring Struggle Jennings and Demun Jones, and "Dirty Money", featuring Justin Moore, as the album's third and fourth promotional singles, respectively.[27][28]

Songwriting[edit]
In addition to his original work, Gilbert has written songs that Colt Ford and Jason Aldean have recorded. The songs "Dirt Road Anthem" (co-written and originally recorded by him and Colt Ford) and "My Kinda Party" were released on Aldean's 2010 album My Kinda Party. "My Kinda Party" was originally recorded by Gilbert on Modern Day Prodigal Son, while "Dirt Road Anthem" was on Halfway to Heaven. Aldean has also covered Gilbert's "The Best of Me", available on the iTunes release of his 2009 album Wide Open.[29] Gilbert has also co-written the tracks "The Same Way" on Aldean's album 9[30] and "Small Town Small" on his album Macon, Georgia.[31]

Personal life[edit]
It was announced in September 2012 that Brantley Gilbert was dating country music singer and actress Jana Kramer. They met at the CMT Music Awards in June 2012. They were engaged on January 20, 2013, his 28th birthday.[32] They split in August 2013.[33][34][35]
In 2013, Gilbert embarked on an eight-day USO tour to entertain American service members stationed in Italy and Kuwait.[36]
Brantley Gilbert was in a near-fatal truck accident when he was 19.[37] Gilbert is an active Christian, and his song "My Faith In You", from his album Just as I Am, speaks of his faith.

Gilbert headlined the NRA's Country Concert in February 2023.[39]
In April 2023, Gilbert smashed a can of Bud Light on stage after saying "Yeah, fuck that". Bud Light had recently become the focus of a boycott from conservatives because of a sponsored Instagram post by transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney."[40][better source needed]
