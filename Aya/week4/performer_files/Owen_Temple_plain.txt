Owen Temple (born September 4, 1976 in Kerrville, Texas) is an American folk and country music songwriter and musician based in Austin, Texas.


Career[edit]
Work with producer and pedal steel guitar musician Lloyd Maines led to 1997's General Store and 1999's Passing Through. The year 2002 saw the release of the Phil Madeira-produced Right Here and Now.
In 2007 and 2011, Temple was a Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk Finalist, and he was the winner of the 2007 B. W. Stevenson Songwriting Competition.
Two Thousand Miles, a fourth studio project, was produced by Maines and was released on January 22, 2008 on El Paisano Records. A review in Allmusic noted "great lyrics full of insight and plainspoken poetry."[1]
A fifth studio album, Dollars and Dimes, was released June 9, 2009.  It is a concept album focused on different regions of North America during hard times.[2] In July 2009, the album was the No. 1 record on the Euro Americana Chart.[3]  In August 2009, the album was No. 5 on the Freeform American Roots chart.[4]
A sixth studio album, Mountain Home, was released April 26, 2011, and the songs on the album focus on small Texas towns and the eccentrics inhabiting them.[5]
Stories They Tell, a seventh studio album, was released on September 24, 2013.[6]
An eighth studio album, Rings on a Tree, was released September 29, 2023, and its songs, many co-written with Walt Wilkins, Hal Ketchum, and others, comprise a concept album focused on intergenerational interactions. [7][8]
A book on songwriting, co-authored with Gordy Quist, titled Songfarmer: Writing More and Better Songs was published on November 1, 2015.[9]
Dreamer: A Tribute to Kent Finlay, released in early 2016 on Austin-based Eight 30 Records, features Temple's version of Finlay's "Mines of Terlingua."[10]
