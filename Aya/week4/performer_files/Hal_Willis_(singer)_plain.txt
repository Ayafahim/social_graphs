His famous country single was "The Lumberjack," an international hit that sold over 1.5 million copies. In 1965, it peaked at number 5 on the Billboard country charts in the USA. This success was such a phenomenon that he was nicknamed "Mr. Lumberjack."

At this time, Hal and Ginger were also rock and roll singers recording songs like "My Pink Cadillac" and "Bop a Dee Bop a Doo." Hal and Ginger, along with Hank Snow, were the only Canadian performers to tour with Elvis Presley. He also performed and toured through his career with many American Country Music Hall of Fame singers such as Patsy Cline, Webb Pierce, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Porter Wagoner, Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson.
