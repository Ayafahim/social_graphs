The Time Jumpers is the name of a Western swing band formed in 1998 by a group of Nashville studio musicians who enjoyed jamming together.[1] Country star Vince Gill was a member of the group between 2010 and 2020.[2] The 11–member group started playing occasional local gigs until they agreed to take a regular slot playing at the Station Inn, a venerable Nashville bluegrass venue.[3][4] They later moved to a larger venue, Nashville's "3rd & Lindsley", and were called by Tennessean writer Juli Thanki, "One of the hottest shows in town".[5] Some of their guest artists on the weekly live show have included Joe Walsh,[6] Robert Plant, Norah Jones, Bonnie Raitt,[5] Reba McEntire, Jimmy Buffett, Kings of Leon,  and Toby Keith.[7] Amy Grant said, "You can't hear that caliber of musicians every Monday night for a cover charge in any town in America except here".[8] The group rarely travels, but in 2010 they performed at New York's Lincoln Center.[9] In 2007, they recorded a live album entitled Jumpin' Time and in 2012 recorded The Time Jumpers.  At the 2017 Grammy Awards the group won "Best American Roots Song" for Vince Gill's composition "Kid Sister".[10]
