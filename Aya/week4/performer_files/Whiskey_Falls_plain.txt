Biography[edit]
The band's lead singer is Seven Williams (born Keith Volpone). Whiskey Falls' other three members, Wally Brandt, Buck Johnson, and Damon Johnson (the latter two are no relation), all sing lead and harmony vocals and play guitar, and Buck Johnson plays keyboard as well.[1] In 2007, Whiskey Falls signed to a recording contract with Midas Records Nashville label. Their self-titled debut album produced two Top 40 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts in "Last Train Running" (#32)[2] and "Falling Into You" (#40).[3][4]
In the short time together as a band, Whiskey Falls was named 2008's “Breakout Band of the Year” by Nashville's Music Row, has been featured in People Magazine, USA Weekend, Billboard Magazine and Country Weekly.  They have also made appearances on national television including performances on The Early Show, The Jimmy Kimmel Show, Extra!, GAC,[5] and at several NASCAR pre-race events,[6] as well as being featured in television commercials for AAMCO Transmissions.[7][8]
The group and their song "Load Up the Bases (The Baseball Song)" are featured in promos for Atlanta Braves telecasts on FSN South and SportSouth,[9] as well as for Colorado Rockies telecasts on FSN Rocky Mountain. This song also charted at No. 55 on the country music charts from unsolicited airplay during the 2007 World Series. It was re-released again in 2008 and re-entered at No. 55 on the country charts from unsolicited airplay during the 2008 World Series.
In the summer of 2009, Damon Johnson returned to the Alice Cooper Band and was featured in Cooper's 2010 live concert DVD & CD, "Theatre of Death - Live At Hammersmith". Johnson worked his fifth tour with Alice Cooper in 2011, and departed the band in September of that year to become a full member of Thin Lizzy. Cooper is also credited with assisting greatly in Johnson's beloved golf game, as the two played hundreds of rounds in their years of touring the world together.
In December 2009, Damon returned for a brief stint with Whiskey Falls to join the Toughest Cowboy Tour. The band also penned the theme song for Mark Burnett's show of the same title on Spike (TV channel).[5][full citation needed]
in December 2011, the band got together to record the Christmas single, "Rudolph Guide My Way" for online downloading.[10]
