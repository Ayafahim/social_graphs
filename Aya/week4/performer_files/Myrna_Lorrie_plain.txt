Myrna Lorraine Petrunka (born August 6, 1940), known professionally as Myrna Lorrie, is a Canadian country singer/songwriter/musician.
Lorrie first sang publicly at age 11 on Fort William radio station CKPR on a program called School of the Air, whose host, Jack Masters,  gave Lorrie her own radio show, Harmony Trails, when she was just 12. At age 14 she wrote and recorded the song "Are You Mine" with Buddy DeVal, which was released on Abbott Records and reached number 6 on the Billboard Chart. The song became a hit in both Canada and the United States and was recorded by several artists; it peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard and Cashbox charts in early 1956. She was voted Best New Female Singer by fan polls in both Billboard and Cashbox magazines in 1955. The Lorrie/De Val team was a part of numerous Grand Ole Opry packages in 1956.[1]
