Wylie Galt Gustafson (born June 7, 1961) is an American singer-songwriter who has toured nationally and internationally with his band, "Wylie & The Wild West". The band is known for its blend of cowboy, traditional country, folk and yodeling.[1] Wylie is renowned for his creation of the ubiquitous Yahoo! yodel used in the tech company's worldwide advertising campaign.[1] Gustafson is a fourth generation Montana cowboy and is a 2019 inductee into the Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame.[2][3][4] He is the younger brother of Lieutenant Governor of Montana Kristen Juras.

Gustafson was born June 7, 1961, near Conrad, Montana,[5] the son of R.W. "Rib" Gustafson, a traditional folk/cowboy singer, retired large-animal veterinarian, and author. The elder Gustafson, who taught his son to sing and yodel, learned to yodel from Austrians on the ski team at Montana State College (now Montana State University), Bozeman, Montana.[1]  Among Rib's credits are two books (Under the Chinook Arch, Room to Roam) about his life as a pioneering Montana veterinarian.
Wylie Gustafson founded his band, The Wild West Show, in 1988, in Los Angeles at the Palomino Club where they were regulars on Ronnie Mack's Barn Dance.[6] It was there that Gustafson showcased the first version of the Wild West Show which then included guitarist Will Ray. The group developed their sound alongside artists such as Dale Watson, Lucinda Williams, Dwight Yoakam, Rosie Flores and Dave Alvin.
Gustafson is particularly noted as a virtuoso yodeler, having originated the slow and ethereal High Plains Yodeling style. He also created and voiced the signature "Yahoo-oo-oo!" for Yahoo, Inc. He later sued Yahoo! for copyright infringement over the terms of the contract and use of his yodel. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.[7] His book and album, How to Yodel: Lessons to Tickle Your Tonsils, was published by Gibbs Smith in 2007 and is the top selling publication on the rejuvenated vocal art. As of 2016, Gustafson remains one of the top choices of yodelers and his style can be heard frequently on national advertisements, television and movies. Some major companies that have used his yodel include Yahoo!, Walt Disney Films, Porsche, Mitsubishi, Miller Lite, Taco Bell and Montana Tourism.
In 1996, Gustafson (as himself) appeared on the Cartoon Network's Space Ghost Coast to Coast (episode "Freak Show").
Gustafson is also an accomplished horseman (2005 & 2008 NCHA Western National Finals Top Ten Open Finalist) and cowboy. When not performing, he operates his Cross Three Quarter Horse Ranch near Conrad, Montana breeding, raising and training cow horses. When Gustafson was young, he was a competitive team roper. Sometimes when at home at his ranch, he participates in roping contests at local ranches.[8] In 1998, he was a champion team roper at the Reba McEntire/Ben Johnson Celebrity Rodeo.[9]
On April 25, 2007, "Montana Lullaby" was declared the official lullaby of Montana. A yodel by Gustafson was used to write the lullaby. As a result, Montana was the first state to have an official lullaby.[10][11]
In October 2019, Wylie was named as an inductee into the Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame.[12]
Gustafson continues to front Wylie & the Wild West Show and they continue to record and tour on a regular basis performing 60–80 shows a year on average. Wylie & the Wild West Show have released twenty-one albums through March 2024.

Personal life[edit]
Wylie on his Montana ranch
Wylie currently resides at his horse and cattle ranch in northern Montana with his wife Jenny and 3 children.[13] His older sister, Kristen Juras,[14] is the current lieutenant governor of Montana. Gustafson also has a brother, Erik, who performed at the 2018 International Blues Challenge Competition.
