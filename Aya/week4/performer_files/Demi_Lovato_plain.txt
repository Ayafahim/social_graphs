After appearing on the children's television series Barney & Friends (2002–2004), she[a] starred in the Disney Channel short series As the Bell Rings (2007–2008). Lovato rose to prominence for playing Mitchie Torres in the musical television film Camp Rock (2008) and its sequel Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010). The former film's soundtrack contained "This Is Me", her debut single and duet, which peaked at number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100.
After signing with Hollywood Records, Lovato released her pop rock debut album, Don't Forget (2008), which debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200.

She earned a Grammy Award nomination for Confident, while "Sorry Not Sorry", the lead single from Tell Me You Love Me, became her highest-charting single in the US, reaching number six. After a hiatus, she released her seventh and eighth albums Dancing with the Devil... the Art of Starting Over (2021) and Holy Fvck (2022), which respectively reached numbers two and seven in the US; the latter marked a return to rock-influenced music.

Early life and career beginnings[edit]
Demetria Devonne Lovato was born on August 20, 1992, in Albuquerque, New Mexico,[5] to former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader Dianna De La Garza (née Lee Smith)[6] and engineer and musician Patrick Martin Lovato.[7] Lovato has an older full sister named Dallas,[8] a younger maternal half-sister, actress Madison De La Garza,[9] and an older paternal half-sister, Amber, whom Lovato first spoke to at age 20.[10]
In mid-1994, shortly after Lovato's second birthday, her parents divorced.[11] Her father was of Nuevomexicano descent, with mostly Spanish and Native American ancestors, and came from a family that had been living in New Mexico for generations; he also had distant Portuguese and Jewish ancestry.[12][13] He was a descendant of Civil War Union veteran Francisco Perea and Santa Fe de Nuevo México governor Francisco Xavier Chávez.[14] Lovato had no interest in forging a relationship with Patrick after her parents divorced.[15] Her mother is of Irish descent.[16][17]
She has been vocal about her strained relationship with her father, calling him abusive and once stated, "He was mean, but he wanted to be a good person. And he wanted to have his family, and when my mom married my stepdad, he still had this huge heart where he said, 'I'm so glad that [he's] taking care of you and doing the job that I wish I could do.'"[18][19] After Patrick died of cancer on June 22, 2013,[20] Lovato said that he had been mentally ill, and she created the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program in his honor.[21]
Lovato was brought up in Dallas, Texas.[22][23] She began playing the piano at age seven and guitar at 10,[24] when she began dancing and acting classes.[25] In 2002, Lovato began her acting career on the children's television series Barney & Friends, portraying the role of Angela.[26] She appeared on Prison Break in 2006 and on Just Jordan the following year.[5] Due to her acting career, Lovato was bullied and consequently requested homeschooling,[27] through which she eventually received her high-school diploma.[28]

Career[edit]
2007–2008: Breakthrough with Camp Rock and Don't Forget[edit]

From 2007 to 2008, Lovato played Charlotte Adams on the Disney Channel short series As the Bell Rings.[29] Lovato auditioned for the channel's television film Camp Rock and series Sonny with a Chance during 2007 and got both roles.[30] Lovato played the lead character, aspiring singer Mitchie Torres, in Camp Rock.[31] The film premiered on June 20, 2008, to 8.9 million viewers.[32] Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Lovato's acting skills were underwhelming and that she has "the knee-jerk smile of someone who is often told she has a great smile".[33] The film's soundtrack was released three days earlier; however, the music was considered less current than that of High School Musical.[34] It debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, with 188,000 units sold in its first week of release.[35] Lovato sang four songs on the soundtrack, including "We Rock" and "This Is Me".[36] The latter, Lovato's debut single, debuted at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and later peaked at number nine, marking her first entry on the chart.[37] That summer, Lovato signed with Hollywood Records and began her Demi Live! Warm Up Tour before the release of her debut studio album,[38] and appeared on the Jonas Brothers' Burnin' Up Tour.[39]
Lovato's debut studio album, Don't Forget, released on September 23, 2008, was met with generally positive reviews from critics.[40][41][42] Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly said, "Demi Lovato might satisfy her 'tween fans but she won't be winning any rockers over with Don't Forget".[43] The album debuted at number two in the US, with first-week sales of 89,000 copies.[44] Ten of its songs were co-written with the Jonas Brothers.[45]
Don't Forget was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for US sales of over 500,000 copies.[46] Its lead single, "Get Back", was praised for its pop rock style and peaked at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100, also selling over 560,000 copies in the United States.[47][48][49] The album's second single, "La La Land", was cited for its strong rock elements[50] and peaked at number 52 in the US,[49] and cracked the top 40 in Ireland and the United Kingdom.[51][52] The music video for the song was directed by Brendan Malloy and Tim Wheeler.[53][full citation needed] The third single[54] and title track, "Don't Forget", peaked at number 41 in the US.[55]

2009–2010: Sonny with a Chance and Here We Go Again[edit]
Lovato's Disney Channel sitcom Sonny with a Chance, in which she played Sonny Munroe, the newest cast member of the show-within-a-show So Random!, premiered on February 8.[56] Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times described Lovato's acting ability as "very good", comparing her favorably to Hannah Montana star Miley Cyrus.[57] That June, Lovato starred as Rosie Gonzalez / Princess Rosalinda in the Disney Channel film Princess Protection Program, alongside Selena Gomez. The film, the fourth highest-rated Disney Channel original movie, premiered to 8.5 million viewers.[58] For the film's soundtrack, the pair recorded the song "One and the Same", which was later released as a promotional single.[59]

Lovato's second studio album, Here We Go Again, was released on July 21, 2009;[5] she described its acoustic style as similar to that of John Mayer.[60] The album received favorable reviews from critics who appreciated its enjoyable pop-rock elements, echoing reviews of Don't Forget.[61] Lovato's first number-one album, it debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 108,000 copies, and was later certified Gold.[62][63] The album's lead single and title track, "Here We Go Again", debuted at number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100, and managed to peak at number 15, becoming Lovato's highest-charting solo single to that point.[64] The song also peaked at number 68 on the Canadian Hot 100 and number 38 in New Zealand.[65][66] "Here We Go Again" was additionally certified Platinum in the US.[63] The album's second and final single, "Remember December" failed to match the success of its predecessor, but peaked at number 80 on the UK Singles Chart. Lovato made her first 40-city national concert tour, Live in Concert, in support of Here We Go Again.[67] The tour, from June 21 to August 21, 2009,[68] had David Archuleta,[68] KSM, and Jordan Pruitt as opening acts.[69] Lovato and Archuleta received the Choice Music Tour award at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards.[70] Lovato was featured alongside the Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus, and Selena Gomez on the song "Send It On", a charity single and the theme song for Disney's Friends for Change.[71][72] All proceeds from the song were donated to environmental charities supported by the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund.[71] Lovato recorded "Gift of a Friend" as a soundtrack for the Disney movie Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure. The movie was released in October 2009.
In 2010, Lovato and Joe Jonas recorded "Make a Wave" as the second charity single for Disney's Friends for Change.[73] That May, Lovato guest-starred as Hayley May, a teenager with schizophrenia, in the sixth-season Grey's Anatomy episode, "Shiny Happy People".[74] Although critics praised her versatility, they were underwhelmed by her acting and felt that her appearance was designed primarily to attract viewers.[75] Later that year, she headlined her first international tour, Demi Lovato: Live in Concert,[76][77] and joined the Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert tour as a guest.[78]
Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam, with Lovato reprising her role as Mitchie Torres, premiered on September 3, 2010.[79][80] Critics were ambivalent about the film's plot, and it has a 40-percent approval rating
on Rotten Tomatoes.[81] However, Lovato's performance was called "dependably appealing" by Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly.[82] The film premiered to eight million viewers, the number-one cable television movie of the year by the number of viewers.[83] Its accompanying soundtrack was released on August 10 with Lovato singing nine songs, including "Can't Back Down" and "Wouldn't Change a Thing".[84] The soundtrack debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 41,000 copies.[85] Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert was reworked to incorporate Lovato and the rest of the film's cast;[86] it began on August 7, two weeks later than planned.[87] The Sonny with a Chance soundtrack was released on October 5; Lovato sang on four tracks, including "Me, Myself and Time".[88] It debuted (and peaked) at number 163 on the Billboard 200, her lowest-selling soundtrack.[89] In November 2010, Lovato announced her departure from Sonny with a Chance, putting her acting career on hiatus and ending the series;[90] she later said that she would return to acting when she felt confident doing so.[91] Her departure led to the actual spin-off series So Random! with the Sonny cast, featuring sketches from the former show-within-a-show. The series was canceled after one season.[92]

Lovato released her third studio album, Unbroken, on September 20, 2011.[93] Begun in July 2010, the album experimented with R&B and featured less pop rock than her first two albums.[94] Lyrically, Unbroken encompassed more mature themes as opposed to Lovato's previous works, with some songs focusing on her personal struggles.[95] The album and its stylistic change received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Lovato's vocals and saw a growth in her musicianship due to the songs focusing on her struggles, but criticized the album's "party songs" and found the music to be more generic than her previous efforts.[96] Unbroken debuted at number four in the US, selling 97,000 copies in its first week of release; it was later certified Gold.[97]
"Skyscraper", the lead single from Unbroken, was released on July 12, and was noted for its messages of self-worth and confidence.[98] It debuted at number ten in the US, selling 176,000 downloads during the first week of release, becoming Lovato's highest first week sales at the time.[99] The song also became Lovato's highest-charting single since "This Is Me" peaking at number nine in July 2008,[99] and it also debuted at number two on the Hot Digital Songs chart.[100] "Skyscraper" received the Best Video With a Message award at the September 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, and the track was also certified Platinum by the RIAA and Silver by the BPI.[101] The album's second and final single, "Give Your Heart a Break", was released on January 23, 2012, and later peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 16, making Lovato's fourth highest-charting song to that point.[102] It peaked at number 12 on the US Adult Top 40 chart and number one on the US Pop Songs chart. It also became the longest climb by a female artist[b] to reach No. 1 in the Pop Songs chart history until 2019, when Halsey's feature on "Eastside" broke the record.[49][103] The song was certified triple Platinum in the US; as of October 2014[update], "Give Your Heart a Break" has sold 2.1 million digital copies.[104] Billboard has ranked the song as Lovato's best, calling it "timeless".[105]
In May, Lovato became a judge and mentor for the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, with a reported salary of one million dollars.[106] Joining Britney Spears, Simon Cowell, and L.A. Reid,[107] it was speculated that she was chosen to attract a younger audience.[108] Mentoring the Young Adults category, her final act (CeCe Frey) finished sixth.[109] At the Minnesota State Fair in August, Lovato announced that after a pre-show performance at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards[110] she would release a single by December.[111] On December 24, she released a video on her YouTube account of herself singing "Angels Among Us" dedicated to the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[112] In March, she was confirmed as returning for The X Factor's third season,[113] with her salary reportedly doubling.[114]

Artistry[edit]
Influences[edit]
Lovato credits Kelly Clarkson (left) and Christina Aguilera (right) as her main musical influences.
Lovato has frequently cited "power vocalists" such as Christina Aguilera, Kelly Clarkson, Whitney Houston, and Aretha Franklin as major musical and vocal influences.[287][288] Lovato says, "I had a lot of respect for Whitney Houston, and Christina Aguilera."[289] About her admiration for Clarkson, Lovato says, "I just thought she was a great role model. I feel like she set a really great example and she was extremely talented."[290] Lovato also said that she was "obsessed with Kelly Clarkson" as a child, and she even had an AOL username, "Little Kelly", inspired by the singer.[291]
Her other influences or inspirations include Britney Spears,[292] Rihanna, JoJo, Keri Hilson,[293] Jennifer Lopez,[294] Gladys Knight, Alexz Johnson,[295] Billie Holiday, the Spice Girls,[296] and Billy Gilman.[287] About Gilman she said, "We had the same voice range when I was young. I would practice to his songs all the time."[297] In her teens, Lovato listened to heavy metal music,[298] including bands such as the Devil Wears Prada, Job for a Cowboy, Maylene and the Sons of Disaster, and Bring Me the Horizon.[299] She has said that John Mayer's songwriting has in particular been a "huge influence" on hers[287] and that he taught her to write songs by starting with the titles.[244] Following the release of Unbroken, her musical style shifted towards hip hop and R&B.[287] Upon the release of the song "Without a Fight" by country music singer Brad Paisley featuring Lovato, she cited the country genre as a lifelong strong musical influence of hers, as she "grew up listening to country" and her mother "was a country singer".[300]
Lovato's Neon Lights Tour was "inspired by Beyoncé" and specifically her 2013 self-titled visual album in regard to the visuals shown onscreen.[301] Moreover, Lovato revealed that her sixth studio album, Tell Me You Love Me, was inspired by Aguilera.[302] Lovato said "I grew up listening to Christina Aguilera. She was one of my idols growing up. She still is. Her voice is incredible, and in Stripped you really got to hear that. I think it was her breakout album that really transformed her into the icon that she is today. So that inspired me … she really inspired this album. I was even inspired by the black and white artwork!"[302]

Voice[edit]
Throughout her career, Lovato has received acclaim from critics for her singing abilities and mezzo-soprano voice.[303][304][305]  Regarding her vocals on Don't Forget, Nick Levine of Digital Spy stated, "she's certainly a stronger singer than the Jonases. In fact, her full-bodied vocal performances are consistently impressive."[306] Becky Brain of Idolator remarked that Lovato has a "killer voice and the A-list material to put it to good use".[307] According to Sophie Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter, Lovato "has a voice that can silence even the harshest of critics."[308] In his review of Lovato's second studio album Here We Go Again, Jeff Miers from The Buffalo News stated, "Unlike so many of her Disney-fied peers, Lovato can really sing," and he found it "refreshing" that she "doesn't need the help of Auto-Tune ... to mask any lack of natural ability."[309]
Commenting on working with Lovato on her third studio album Unbroken, Ryan Tedder stated that Lovato "blew me out of the water vocally! I had no idea how good her voice is. She's one of the best singers I've ever worked with. Literally, that good ... I mean, she's a Kelly Clarkson-level vocalist. And Kelly has a set of pipes." He also commented on their work together on the song "Neon Lights" from her fourth studio album, saying that Lovato "has one of the biggest ranges, possibly the highest full voice singer I've ever worked with."[310] Tamsyn Wilce from Alter the Press commented on her vocals on Demi, stating "it shows just how strong her vocal chords  [sic] are and the variation of styles that she can completely work to make her own."[311]
In a review of the Neon Lights Tour, Mike Wass from Idolator remarked "you don't need shiny distractions when you can belt out songs like Demi and connect with the crowd on such an emotional level".[312] In a review of the Demi World Tour, Marielle Wakim from Los Angeles magazine praised Lovato's vocals, commenting, "For those who haven't bothered to follow Lovato's career, let's get something out of the way: [Lovato] can sing.... At 22 years old, her vocal range is astounding." Wakim also described Lovato's vocals as "spectacular".[313]
Lovato was lauded for her performance of "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Super Bowl LIV in 2020. Patrick Ryan of USA Today commended her for delivering a "flawless performance" and described Lovato as "one of the best vocalists in the industry today".[314] He remarked that Lovato "hit all the high notes with ease" and ultimately "even added some of her own riffs" which he says resulted in "a rendition that was uniquely and phenomenally" her own.[314]

Personal life[edit]
Residence[edit]
On August 20, 2010, her 18th birthday, Lovato purchased a Mediterranean-style house in Los Angeles for her family; however, Lovato decided to live in a "sober house" in Los Angeles after leaving rehab in January 2011.[315] In September 2016, Lovato also purchased a Laurel Canyon home in Los Angeles for $8.3 million, which she sold in June 2020 for $8.25 million.[316] In September 2020, Lovato purchased a Studio City home in Los Angeles for $7 million.[317]

Sexuality, gender, and relationships[edit]
For a few months, Lovato dated singer Trace Cyrus in 2009.[320] Lovato briefly dated her Camp Rock co-star Joe Jonas in 2010.[321] Lovato then had an on-again, off-again relationship with actor Wilmer Valderrama; they first began dating in August 2010 when Valderrama was 29 and Lovato was 18. They ended their relationship in June 2016.[322] Her 2022 single "29" was widely believed to be about Valderrama and the significant age gap in their relationship, although Lovato did not directly confirm this.[323][324] Lovato later dated UFC athlete Guilherme "Bomba" Vasconcelos from January to July 2017.[325] In late 2018, Lovato briefly dated designer Henry Levy until March 2019.[326] She dated model Austin Wilson for a few months until late 2019.[327] On July 23, 2020, Lovato announced her engagement to actor Max Ehrich.[328] The two had begun dating four months prior, but eventually called off the engagement that September.[329] In early August 2022, People reported that Lovato was in a "happy and healthy relationship" with a male musician.[330] On August 20, Canadian musician Jutes announced the relationship in an Instagram post marking Lovato's 30th birthday.[331][332] On December 16, 2023, it was announced Lovato and Jutes were engaged.[333]
Lovato describes her sexuality as fluid, and has said she is open to finding love with someone of any gender.[334][335] In July 2020, she labeled herself queer in a social media statement mourning the death of her Glee co-star Naya Rivera.[336] In March 2021, Lovato came out as pansexual and sexually fluid, stating, "I've always known I was hella queer, but I have fully embraced it." In the same interview, she called herself "just too queer" to date men at the time. She also expressed feeling proud of belonging to the "alphabet mafia", referring to the LGBT community.[337][338]
On May 19, 2021, Lovato publicly came out as non-binary and announced the decision to change her gender pronouns to they/them, stating that "this has come after a lot of healing and self-reflective work. I'm still learning and coming into myself; I don't claim to be an expert or a spokesperson. Sharing this with you now opens another level of vulnerability for me."[339][340] She had previously come out as non-binary to her family and friends towards the end of 2020.[341][342][343] Lovato later changed her pronouns to include she/her in April 2022,[344] and described herself the following August as a "fluid person" who had "adopted the pronouns of she/her again" after starting to feel "more feminine".[345][346] That September, she reiterated that she "still feel[s] very comfortable with they/them".[347]

Mental health and substance abuse[edit]
Lovato had suffered from bulimia nervosa, self-harm, and being bullied before her first stint in rehab at age 18.[348][349] On November 1, 2010, Lovato withdrew from the Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert tour, entering a treatment facility for "physical and emotional issues".[350] It was reported[351] that she decided to enter treatment after punching backup dancer Alex Welch; her family and management team convinced her that she needed help. Lovato said she took "100 percent, full responsibility" for the incident.[348] On January 28, 2011, she completed in-patient treatment at Timberline Knolls and returned home. Lovato acknowledged that she had bulimia, had cut herself, and had been "self-medicating" with drugs and alcohol "like a lot of teens do to numb their pain".[352] She added that she "basically had a nervous breakdown" and had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder during her treatment.[353] She later commented that she used to use cocaine several times a day and smuggled cocaine onto airplanes.[354] In a 2022 interview on the podcast Call Her Daddy, Lovato added that she began using opiates at the age of 13 after a car accident and "was already drinking" by that time.[355][356] She said that this eventually led her to use cocaine at the age of 17.[355]

Lovato speaking at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July 2016
In April 2011, Lovato became a contributing editor for Seventeen magazine, penning an article that described her struggles.[357] In March 2012, MTV aired a documentary, Demi Lovato: Stay Strong, about her rehab and recovery.[358] She began work on her fourth studio album the following month.[359] In January 2013, it was reported that Lovato had been living in a sober-living facility in Los Angeles for over a year because she felt it was the best way to avoid returning to her addiction and eating disorder.[360] Lovato celebrated the five-year anniversary of her sobriety on March 15, 2017.[361]
In her 2017 YouTube documentary Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated, Lovato revealed that her treatment at Timberline Knolls had not been entirely successful, stating that she still struggled with alcoholism and a cocaine addiction in the year following her stint in the treatment center and further admitting that she was in fact under the influence of cocaine while being interviewed about her sobriety for Demi Lovato: Stay Strong.[362][363][364][365] She stated, "I wasn't working my program. I wasn't ready to get sober. I was sneaking it on planes, sneaking it in bathrooms, sneaking it throughout the night. Nobody knew."[363]
Lovato also stated that her drug and alcohol addiction not only caused her to nearly overdose several times, but later began to impact her ability to perform live and promote her Unbroken album, referencing a 2012 performance on American Idol where she was severely hungover.[362][364][365] After her management team had expressed their intentions to leave her, Lovato agreed to resume treatment and counseling for her addiction, leading to her move to a sober-living facility in Los Angeles with roommates and responsibilities to help her overcome her drug and alcohol problems.[362][365] Although she had previously stated that she was entirely done with hard drugs such as heroin, Lovato revealed in March 2021 that she was not completely sober; she drank alcohol and smoked marijuana in moderation at that point, a choice that many of her friends openly disagreed with. She decided on moderation as she felt she was setting herself up for failure if she told herself she was never going to drink or smoke again. Lovato said it was because it had been drilled into her that "one drink was equivalent to a crack pipe."[366] This changed the following December when she abandoned her "California sober ways" and declared herself "sober sober".[367][368]
In 2021, Lovato said she had initially accepted her bipolar diagnosis and shared this in 2011 because it explained her erratic behavior, but later came to believe it was inaccurate: "I was acting out when I was 18 for many reasons, but I know now from multiple different doctors that it was not because I was bipolar. I had to grow the fuck up."[369] Lovato also stated that the diagnosis has been revised to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[370]

2018 drug overdose[edit]
On June 21, 2018, Lovato released the single "Sober" in which she revealed she had relapsed after six years of sobriety.[371] On July 24, 2018, she was rushed to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after emergency services were called to her home due to an opioid overdose.[372][373] Lovato recalled, "The doctors told me that I had five to 10 minutes, like, if no one had found me, then I wouldn't be here."[374] The singer was reported to be stable and recovering later in the day.[372] She reportedly overdosed on oxycodone laced with fentanyl[375] and was revived with naloxone.[376]
Lovato also had multiple health complications stemming from the overdose, including multiple strokes, a heart attack, and brain damage, the latter of which caused lasting vision problems.[377] She was hospitalized for two weeks and subsequently entered an in-patient rehab facility.[378]
Lovato's drug overdose received widespread media coverage, leading to her becoming the most googled person of 2018, ahead of other figures who had received extensive coverage throughout the year, due largely to the public interest surrounding the overdose.[379] CBS News ranked the overdose the 29th biggest story of 2018.[380]
In December 2018, Lovato took to Twitter to dismiss rumors regarding her overdose and went on to thank fans, writing, "If I feel like the world needs to know something, I will tell them MYSELF. All my fans need to know is I'm working hard on myself, I'm happy and clean and I'm SO grateful for their support."[381] She added that some day she would "tell the world what exactly happened, why it happened and what my life is like today .. but until I'm ready to share that with people please stop prying and making up shit that you know nothing about. I still need space and time to heal."[381]
Lovato addressed the matter during a 2020 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, elaborating on how her worsened struggles with bulimia in 2018 contributed to her eventual drug overdose as she relapsed three months prior to the incident due to being extremely unhappy.[382] The singer attributed these struggles to the extreme measures that her then-manager, Phil McIntyre, took to control the food she ingested.[383] Lovato further explained that, along with the controlling nature of her management team, they did not provide her with the help she needed: "People checking what my orders at Starbucks were on my bank statements ... just little things like that ... it led me to being really unhappy and my bulimia got really bad and I asked for help and I didn't receive the help that I needed."[383] Moreover, she recounted that her thought process the night she relapsed after six years of sobriety was as follows, "I'm six years sober and I'm miserable. I'm even more miserable than I was when I was drinking. Why am I sober?"[383] When Lovato confronted her management about these thoughts, the latter responded with, "You're being very selfish, this would ruin things for not just you but for us as well." This made Lovato feel "completely abandoned" due to triggering her underlying abandonment issues with her birth father, and so she "drank ... that night".[383]

Rape trauma[edit]
In 2021, Lovato said she was raped at age 15 when she was an actor on the Disney Channel, and that the rapist was a co-star whom she had to continue seeing thereafter. The incident contributed to her bulimia and self-harm. She told someone about the incident, but the assaulter "never got in trouble for it. They never got taken out of the movie they were in." Lovato stated she did not acknowledge the act as rape at the time, because sexual activity was not normalized to her, and she was part of the Disney crowd who wore purity rings and were waiting until marriage. However, she decided to share her experience because she believed that everyone should "speak their voice if they can and feel comfortable doing so". Lovato also stated she was raped during her 2018 drug overdose, realizing a month after the incident that she was not in a place to consent at that point.[384][385]

But I just found that you can have your own relationship with God, and I still have a lot of faith."[388] In May 2014, Lovato was named lead performer for NYC Pride Week and Grand Marshal of the LA Pride Parade, where she later filmed the music video for "Really Don't Care".[389][390] Lovato became the face of Human Rights Campaign's America's for Marriage Equality in 2015.[391] In June 2016, Lovato participated in a video released by the Human Rights Campaign honoring the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting.[392][393]

And showing women that you can embrace your sexuality and you deserve to have confidence and you don't need to conform to society's views on what women should be or how you should dress. So, I think it is just about supporting other women and empowering other women."[402] In May 2017, Lovato partnered with Fabletics to create a limited edition activewear collection[403] for the United Nations Foundation's Girl Up campaign to fund programs for "the world's most marginalized adolescent girls".[404][405]
