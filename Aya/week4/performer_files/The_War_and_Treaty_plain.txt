The War and Treaty are an American husband and wife duo consisting of singer-songwriters Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Trotter.[1][2] Their debut studio album Healing Tide (2018), received critical acclaim upon its release. Soon afterwards, they released their sophomore album Hearts Town (2020), which featured a collaboration with American singer Emmylou Harris, and spawned the Triple A top 40 hit single "Five More Minutes".[3] In 2022, they signed to UMG Nashville, and released their major label debut  Lover's Game (2023). Their collaboration with Zach Bryan on the song "Hey Driver" reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. 
In 2023, The War and Treaty became the first black duo to be nominated for the Country Music Association Award for Duo of the Year;[4] along with being the first black duo to be nominated for the Academy of Country Music Award for Duo of the Year.[5] They have received two nominations for the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist. An upcoming biopic based on the group’s life is set to be released.[6][7]


Career[edit]
In 2016, Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount released the duet album Love Affair as Trotter & Blount.[8] In 2017, The War and Treaty released the EP Down to the River, described as a mix of 'blues, gospel, soul, bluegrass, country' and heralded by Estey as 'a splendidly made immediate classic about conflict and redemption'.[9][10] Yet the two can sensually help heal the wounds from those confessional blasts with a sweet ballad like "Till The Mornin’" — they truly live up to the dynamic tension of their moniker.'[10]
In 2018, Rolling Stone reported The War and Treaty's debut album Healing Tide is due for release on August 10, 2018, describing the lead single as a 'joyfully relentless title track, reminiscent of classic Ike and Tina Turner rock-infused soul'.[11]
On September 25, 2020, The War and Treaty released their sophomore studio album, Hearts Town, on Rounder Records. On April 18, 2021 they joined Dierks Bentley for a performance of U2's "Pride (In the Name of Love)" for the 56th Academy of Country Music Awards.[12]
The group signed a major label deal with Universal Music Group Nashville in May 2022.[13] They performed a cover of "It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)" alongside Brothers Osborne at the 56th Annual Country Music Association Awards on November 9, 2022 and surprise-released their second EP Blank Page on the same day.[14] Their major label debut album Lover's Game, was released on March 10, 2023. 
The duo collaborated with American country star Zach Bryan on the track "Hey Driver" from his self-titled fourth studio album. The song debuted at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 marking the duo's first appearance on the chart.[15]
