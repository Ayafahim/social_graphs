Marlee Scott (born January 1, 1986, in Richmond Hill, Ontario[1]) is a Canadian country music singer and songwriter. She now resides in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2004, Scott was the winner of Corus Entertainment's Rising Country Superstar Challenge, which led to a record deal with 306 Records and the release of her first album, Souvenir, in 2005. That album saw four singles released to country radio, and her video for "I Fall in Love Too Fast" received airplay on CMT.
Scott signed a new management deal with Big Ride Management in February 2008. Big Ride Management is headed by Gerry Leiske, who previously managed Emerson Drive, and is based in Nashville, Tennessee. She released a new, self-titled album in November 2008, on independent record label Big Ride Entertainment.
