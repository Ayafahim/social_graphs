Early life[edit]
Green is from Flint, Texas. He attended A&M Consolidated High School in College Station, Texas, graduating in 2004 before he went to Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas.[2] It took six years for him to graduate as he concentrated on his music career.[1]

2012: Rose Queen[edit]
In 2012, Green recorded his third album, Rose Queen, at Sixteen Ton Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. The album was released on April 30, 2013. This became his breakthrough album. The first single from the album was "It’s About Time," which became his first Top Ten song on Texas Radio.[3] He had a No. 1 regional hit with the song "She Likes the Beatles,"[4] and the album yielded three top ten singles on the Texas country charts.[5]  According to Green, the album was inspired by the town of Tyler, Texas which has a local tradition called the Texas Rose Festival.[6]

According to Green, the album was inspired by the town of Eastland, Texas.[7]
Green contributed a song to Dreamer: A Tribute to Kent Finlay, an album released in early 2016 on Austin-based Eight 30 Records, titled "Still Think About You." This work is a co-write with Finlay.[11]
