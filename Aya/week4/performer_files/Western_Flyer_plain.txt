Western Flyer was an American country music band founded in 1992 by Danny Myrick (lead vocals, bass guitar), Chris Marion (keyboards, vocals), T. J. Klay (harmonica, mandolin, vocals), Bruce Gust (drums, vocals), Steve Charles (lead guitar, vocals), and Roger Helton (acoustic guitar, banjo, vocals). The band released two albums for Step One Records, as well as six singles. Their highest peaking single is "What Will You Do with M-E?", which reached No. 32 on the Billboard country charts in 1996. After Western Flyer disbanded, Marion joined the Little River Band, and Myrick began writing songs for other artists.


History[edit]
Western Flyer was founded in 1992 by lead singer and bass guitarist Danny Myrick and keyboardist Chris Marion. Completing the lineup were harmonicist/mandolinist T.J. Klay, drummer Bruce Gust, lead guitarist Steve Charles, and guitarist/banjoist Roger Helton. The band members met in Nashville at a church where some of them had been playing in the church band.  The band took the name Western Flyer from a brand of bicycle.[1][2]
The group signed to the independent Step One Records label in 1993, and released a self-titled debut album a year later. This album accounted for five chart singles, of which four reached the lower regions of the Billboard country charts. The album's third release, "Cherokee Highway", did not chart in the U.S., although it was a Top 40 hit on the RPM Country Tracks charts and received media attention for its story of interracial violence.[3][4]
Western Flyer's second album, 1996's Back in America, produced its highest charting single in "What Will You Do with M-E?" which reached No. 32 on the U.S. country charts.[1] Also included on this album were "She Wants to Be Wanted Again," which Ty Herndon also released on his 1996 album Living in a Moment and released as a single in 1997, and "Lost in You", which received a "Critic's Choice" review in Billboard.[5] Back in America produced no other chart singles, and Western Flyer disbanded in 1997. Marion subsequently joined the Little River Band, a rock group, in 2004. Danny Myrick signed to a songwriting contract with 3 Ring Circus Music, which is owned by Jeffrey Steele. Myrick has co-written "International Harvester" for Craig Morgan, "Loud" for Big & Rich,[6] the Number One hit "She's Country" for Jason Aldean, and "How Far Do You Wanna Go?" by Gloriana.
