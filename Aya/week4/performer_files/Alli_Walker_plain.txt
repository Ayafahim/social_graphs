Alli Jean Walker is a Canadian country music singer, songwriter, and model from Summerside, Prince Edward Island. She is currently signed to Records Nashville.[2]


Early life[edit]
Walker grew up in Prince Edward Island.  After learning the piano and drums, she learned how to play the bagpipes, and attended several international bagpiping competitions. Walker turned down a scholarship to the University of Arkansas, as she was inspired by Taylor Swift to pursue a career in country music.[3] She attended the University of Prince Edward Island for one year as a vocal major, but elected to drop out as the program was focused on classical training.[3] In 2009, Walker moved to Toronto, Ontario to pursue a career in country music and modelling.[4][5] She met her husband at a Rascal Flatts concert soon after moving to Toronto.[5]

Career[edit]
After ten years of developing her music, Walker released her debut album The Basement Sessions: What I've Learned So Far on September 13, 2019.[5][6] She recorded the songs in the basement of her home with her husband.[7][8]
Shortly thereafter, Walker and her husband moved to Kelowna, British Columbia.[9] She subsequently released her second album Growing Up on March 10, 2023.[10][11] The album included the single "Red Wine or Whiskey", and several previously released songs including "Country Music", "Maybe I'm Still Drunk", and a female point-of-view version of "Sand in My Boots".[12][13]
Later that year, Walker released the song "The Whiskey's Gone".[14] The song garnered significant attention on social media, and Walker subsequently moved with her husband to Nashville, Tennessee, at the end of the year, and released the song "Hung Up".
[15][16] In March 2024, Walker signed her first record deal with RECORDS Nashville and released the single "I Like Big Trucks".[17][18][19] In April 2024, Walker received a significant amount of media attention after she performed her song "Creek" at a Nashville Predators playoff hockey game and drank beer from the mouth of a dead catfish.[20][21][22] A video of the incident was later shown on Hockey Night in Canada as well as an ESPN national broadcast in the United States.[23] Walker received a nomination for Female Artist of the Year at the 2024 Canadian Country Music Awards.[24]
