Early life[edit]
Blake Tollison Shelton was born in Ada, Oklahoma, to Dorothy Ann (née Bristol) (b. 1936), a beauty salon owner, and Richard Lee "Dick" Shelton (1940–2012), a car salesman. Shelton began singing at an early age and by the age of 12, he was taught how to play the guitar by his uncle.[7] By age 15, he had written his first song. By age 16, he had received a Denbo Diamond Award in his home state.[1] On November 13, 1990, his older brother, Richie Shelton was killed in an automobile accident at 24.
[8] After graduating from high school at 17, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a singing career. There he got a job at a music publishing company and, in 1997, he was aided by Bobby Braddock to obtain a production contract with Sony Music.[9]

Music career[edit]
2001–2006: Beginnings[edit]
Shelton performing at the Crawford County Fair in Meadville, PA, in August 2005 Some years later in Nashville, he signed to Giant Records. In 2001, he was slated to release a song entitled "I Wanna Talk About Me" as a single. However, staff at the label considered the song unsuitable for a lead-off single, and the song was eventually recorded by Toby Keith, whose version was a number 1 single.[10]
Instead, Giant released "Austin" as Shelton's debut single. Shortly after that song was released, Giant Records was closed, and Shelton was transferred to parent company Warner Bros. Records. "Austin" became Shelton's first number-one hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and spent five weeks at that position. Warner released Shelton's self-titled debut album, which was produced by songwriter Bobby Braddock. It also produced the Top 20 hits "All Over Me", which Shelton co-wrote with Earl Thomas Conley and Mike Pyle, and "Ol' Red".[1] Although Shelton's rendition of "Ol' Red" was not a major radio hit, he considers it his signature song, and it has become popular in concert.[11] The album received a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies.[12]
The album received a positive review from Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic, who called "Austin" "tremendously imaginative" and praised Shelton for including songs written by Braddock and Conley.[13] Country Standard Time was less favorable, with Scott Homewood saying that the "album just smacks of being assembled with the intent on capturing the burgeoning alternative country market".[14]
Shelton's second album, The Dreamer, was first released on February 4, 2003, on Warner Bros. Records. Its lead-off single, "The Baby", reached No. 1 on the country charts, holding that position for three weeks. Although the second and third singles ("Heavy Liftin'" and "Playboys of the Southwestern World", respectively) only reached No. 32 and No. 24, The Dreamer earned gold certification, as well. He, along with Andy Griggs and Montgomery Gentry, sang guest vocals on Tracy Byrd's mid-2003 single "The Truth About Men". Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill was the title of Shelton's third studio album, released in 2004.[1] Its lead-off single, the Harley Allen co-write "When Somebody Knows You That Well", peaked at No. 37 on the country charts, while the follow-up "Some Beach" became his third No. 1 hit, holding that position for four weeks. It was followed by a cover of Conway Twitty's 1988 single "Goodbye Time".[15] Both this cover and its followup, "Nobody but Me", reached Top Ten for Shelton, as well. As with his first album, Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill was certified platinum. Accompanying the album's release was a video collection entitled Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill: A Video Collection.[1]
On December 18, 2005, several of Shelton's songs, including "Nobody but Me", appeared on the TV movie The Christmas Blessing, starring Neil Patrick Harris, Rebecca Gayheart, Angus T. Jones, and Rob Lowe. Shelton had a small role at the end of the movie, playing himself at a benefit concert, singing "Nobody But Me".

Shelton released his fourth studio album, Pure BS, in early 2007.[1] Unlike with his first three albums, which were produced entirely by Bobby Braddock, Shelton worked with Braddock, Brent Rowan, and Paul Worley as producers for this album. Its first two singles—"Don't Make Me" and "The More I Drink"—were both Top 20 hits on the country charts, respectively reaching No.12 and No. 19. Also in late 2007, Shelton made appearances on television shows: first as a judge on the talent competition Nashville Star, and later on Clash of the Choirs.
Pure BS was re-released in 2008 with three bonus tracks, including a cover of Michael Bublé's hit single "Home". This cover, released in early 2008 as the album's third single, became his fourth No.1 hit in July.[16]
"Home" was followed in August 2008 by the single "She Wouldn't Be Gone", his 14th chart entry and his fifth No. 1 hit. It was the first time in his career that he had two consecutive number ones. "She Wouldn't Be Gone" is the lead-off to Shelton's fifth studio album, Startin' Fires, which has also produced the single "I'll Just Hold On". This album also includes "Bare Skin Rug", a duet with Lambert.[17] It was produced by Scott Hendricks, except for one track which was produced by Brent Rowan, and another ("I Don't Care", which carried over from Pure BS) was produced by Braddock.[18] After "I'll Just Hold On" fell off the chart in October 2009, Shelton released a duet with Trace Adkins titled "Hillbilly Bone". It was the lead single on Shelton's EP, Hillbilly Bone, released on March 2, 2010, through Reprise Records Nashville. After "Hillbilly Bone" reached No. 1 in February, came the August release of All About Tonight, the lead-off single to his EP of the same name.

On March 13, 2019, he performed a private concert at his Ole Red Gatlinburg location, celebrating its weeklong grand opening. Shelton earned $29,214 from ticket sales and, along with $25,000 from Ryman Hospitality Properties, donated the sum of $54,214 to the Gatlinburg-Pittman High School's music programs.[131]
For a short time at the end of March 2020 into the beginning of April 2020, Shelton reduced the price of his merchandise and donated a portion of his sales to the MusiCares COVID-19 relief fund.[132]
In April 2020, Shelton donated $150,000 to the "Give from Home Day" fundraiser, a partnership between Oklahoma City ABC affiliate news station KOCO 5 and the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma with the goal to help feed the hungry during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.[133]
