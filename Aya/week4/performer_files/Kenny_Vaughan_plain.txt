Kenneth Vaughan is an American guitarist. He is best known as a long-time member of Marty Stuart’s supporting band, The Fabulous Superlatives.


Career[edit]
Early life[edit]
Vaughan was born in Oklahoma, but raised in Denver, Colorado. His guitar instructor was  Bill Frisell. In the late 1960s, Vaughan played in a number of rock bands in the nearby Littleton, Colorado, area (where he lived), including a progressive rock group called Amos. Soon after, Vaughan joined a local progressive jazz band, and then began playing country music in local bars.[1]
Vaughan was a member of the  Colorado punk band Jonny III in the late 1970s and early 80s. This band started Vaughan's partnership with his long-time songwriting partner Jeffrey Leroy Smith, better known as Leroy X.[2] He moved to Nashville in the 1980s, where he became known as a country music guitarist.[3]
Along with Greg Garing, Vaughan was in part responsible for the revitalization of Nashville's historic Lower Broadway district. They drew crowds of listeners while playing in the back room of Tootsie's.[4]
Vaughan was briefly a member of McBride & the Ride in 1994,[5] and later, of Trent Summar & the New Row Mob.[6]

Touring and recording[edit]
Vaughan has been a member of Marty Stuart’s Fabulous Superlatives since its inception in 2002.[7][8] Previously, he toured with Lucinda Williams as she promoted Car Wheels on a Gravel Road. He also has supported Allison Moorer and Kim Richey.[9]
Vaughan's only solo album (so far) is V, made with members of The Fabulous Superlatives and Marty Stuart himself. The album, released in 2011, is a mix of country, rockabilly, and blues songs written by Vaughan, and includes three instrumental tracks.[10][11]
In addition to his session work and touring with the Fabulous Superlatives, Vaughan performs as part of his trio whenever he returns to Nashville. The Kenny Vaughan Trio also includes Jeffrey Clemens (G Love and Special Sauce) on drums and Dave Roe (Johnny Cash) on bass.[12]

Awards[edit]
In 2002, Vaughan was inducted into the Colorado Country Music Hall of Fame.[13]
In 2006, Vaughan received the Americana Music Association's Instrumentalist of the Year award, and the Lifetime Achievement Award for Instrumentalist.[14]

Music Equipment[edit]
Vaughan primarily plays chambered-body guitars by Floyd Cassista with Lindy Fralin pickups. His amplifiers have been a Fender Princeton Reverb and a Valco 1x12 combo.[15]
Working with input from Vaughan, Marty Stuart, and Paul Martin, RS Guitarworks produced the Superlative series of guitars and basses.[16]
