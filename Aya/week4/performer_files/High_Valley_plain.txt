High Valley is a Canadian country and bluegrass band originally from Blumenort, Alberta, a small community near the hamlet of La Crete. The group is composed of Brad Rempel (lead vocals) and his supporting band, Dave Myers (bass guitar), Raymond Klassen (Dobro), Clint Milburn (guitar), and Andrew Hemmerling (drums).[1][2] Brad Rempel's brother Bryan Rempel was a member until March 2014,[3] while younger brother Curtis Rempel was a member until June 2021.[4] All three brothers grew up in a Mennonite community and graduated from La Crete Public School.[5]
After a number of chart successes in Canada between 2010 and 2015, High Valley were signed to Atlantic Records Nashville in October 2015.[6] They achieved some success with the singles "Make You Mine" and "She's with Me" at United States country radio. They have three No. 1 hits on the Billboard Canada Country chart with "I Be U Be", "Grew Up On That", and "River's Still Running".
