The duo signed to EMI Canada in 2008 and released their debut album, Big Sky, in 2009. In 2010, they won the Rising Star award at the Canadian Country Music Association Awards. In August 2011, the duo signed with American pop music label Interscope Records.


History[edit]
In December 2008, One More Girl signed with EMI Music Canada and released their debut single, "I Can Love Anyone", to Canadian country radio shortly after.[1] EMI released the duo's debut album, Big Sky, on October 6, 2009. Another single for EMI, "Fall Like That", was released in early 2011 as the first single from the duo's second album.
In August 2011, the duo signed with Interscope Records, an American pop music label.[2]
The duo released an extended play, The Hard Way, in February 2014 via Open Road Recordings.
Both sisters are also actresses, with Carly known for her role in the series Alice, I Think, while Britt is known for co-starring in the US cable TV series Dead Like Me and also providing the voice of Princess Cadance for My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. By 2023, the group had already disbanded.
