The Sunny Cowgirls is an Australian country music group formed in 2005. They have released a total of seven studio albums since 2005. Their debut album, Little Bit Rusty, was released in 2005. Their latest album, Here We Go, was released in September 2016.


Biography[edit]
The Sunny Cowgirls, Sophie and Celeste Clabburn, grew up on a farm in Hamilton, Victoria. The Clabburn sisters were raised on "Sunninghill", the family farm at Dunkeld near Hamilton, Victoria, before the whole family moved to Perth, Western Australia when they were primary school kids. Their farm was in their father's family a long while, and that's where they came up with the name "Sunny".[1] After four years of working around the country and doing the occasional gig, they raised enough cash to approach well-known Perth record producer Mark Donohoe to showcase their writing and music.
The Cowgirls lives and careers changed in early 2005 when they secured places as aspiring artists in the CMAA College of Country Music, held before the Tamworth Country Music Festival each year. They then signed with Compass Bros Records and their first album, Little Bit Rusty, reached No. 4 on the ARIA country charts.
The Sunny Cowgirls have also collaborated with Adam Brand on "Someday".[when?]
On 1 September 2012 The Sunny Cowgirls performed at the 25th Trundle Bush Tucker Day.
