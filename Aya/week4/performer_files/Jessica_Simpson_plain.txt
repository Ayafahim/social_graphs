Jessica Ann Johnson (née Simpson, born July 10, 1980)[1] is an American singer, actress, and fashion designer. After performing in church choirs as a child, Simpson signed with Columbia Records in 1997, aged seventeen. Her debut studio album, Sweet Kisses (1999), sold two million copies in the United States and was led by the Billboard Hot 100-top three single "I Wanna Love You Forever". Simpson adopted a more mature image for her second studio album, Irresistible (2001), and its namesake lead single track peaked within the top 20 of the chart. The album received gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Simpson's third studio album, In This Skin (2003), sold three million copies in the United States.
During her earlier career, Simpson became known for her relationship with and later marriage to Nick Lachey, with whom she also appeared on the MTV reality television series Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica (2003–2005). Following the release of her first Christmas album ReJoyce: The Christmas Album (2004), which was certified gold, Simpson made her film debut as Daisy Duke in The Dukes of Hazzard (2005). She also recorded a cover of "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'" for the film's soundtrack. In 2006, she released her fifth studio album, A Public Affair and appeared in the romantic comedy film Employee of the Month. With the release of her sixth studio album Do You Know (2008), she moved into the country music genre. A second Christmas album titled Happy Christmas followed in 2010. Simpson has sold 20 million albums worldwide.[2]
Aside from her musical pursuits, Simpson launched The Jessica Simpson Collection in 2005, a fashion-focused line with 34 product categories which has earned over US$1 billion in revenue. She also starred in the reality television series The Price of Beauty in 2010 and judged clothing designs on two seasons of Fashion Star from 2012 to 2013.


Life and career[edit]
1980–1998: Childhood and career beginnings[edit]
Jessica Ann Simpson was born on July 10, 1980, in Abilene, Texas.[1] She is the first child of Tina Ann Simpson (née Drew), a homemaker,[3] and Joseph Simpson, a minister. Simpson's parents married in 1978; they divorced in 2013.[4][5][6][7] Simpson has stated that she grew up in Dallas and Waco, but her parents now live in McGregor, Texas.[8] Simpson has a younger sister, Ashlee.[9] In her preteens she briefly attended Amelia Middle School while her father did outreach in Cincinnati, Ohio. After moving back to Texas 20 months later, she attended J. J. Pearce High School in Richardson during her teenage years, though she had to drop out in 1997 as her career began to take off; a year later she earned her GED via distance learning through Texas Tech High School.[10][11][12] Simpson was raised in the Christian faith, and was given a purity ring by her father when she was twelve years old.[13] Jessica and her family moved frequently due to her father's job as a minister, though they remained in Texas for the most part; however, they did live in the Midwest for a few years.[14]
She began singing in the church choir as a child. When she was eleven, she dreamed of success as a singer while at a church retreat.[14] Simpson auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club at the age of twelve, auditioning with a performance of "Amazing Grace" and dancing to "Ice Ice Baby" (1990).[14] She advanced through multiple rounds, eventually being a semi-finalist for the show alongside artists such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake.[14] Simpson claimed that she became nervous about her final audition after seeing Aguilera perform, and she was ultimately not selected for the show.[14] Simpson resumed performing in her church choir, being discovered by the head of a Christian music label eventually.[14] He asked her for an audition initially and signed her immediately after she performed "I Will Always Love You" (1973) by Dolly Parton.[14] She began working on her debut album with Proclaim Records and touring to promote the project.[14] Simpson's father later claimed that she had to quit touring as the size of her breasts led to her being deemed too "sexual" for the genre.[14]
Her debut album, Jessica, remained unreleased after Proclaim Records went bankrupt; despite this, her grandmother funded a limited pressing of the album personally.[15][16] Shortly after this, Simpson landed several auditions as Jessica was sent to numerous labels and producers.[14] Ultimately, she caught the attention of Tommy Mottola, then married to Mariah Carey and the head of Columbia Records.[14] He went on to sign her to the label at the behest of Columbia talent scout Teresa LaBarbera Whites, claiming "She had a great little look and a great attitude, a fresh new face, and something a bit different than Britney and all of them; she could actually sing."[14] Simpson began working on her debut album in Orlando, Florida.[14] Mottola hoped to market Simpson as a contrast to Spears and Aguilera, both of whom had launched successful careers focused on dancing and sexuality.[14] While working on her musical debut, Simpson enlisted her father Joe as her manager; her mother became her stylist.[17] While at a Christmas party in 1998, Simpson met 98 Degrees singer Nick Lachey, and the two began dating; Lachey claimed that he left the party and told his mother that he would marry Simpson someday.[14]

1999–2001: Breakthrough with early musical releases[edit]
Simpson in January 2001, at the first inauguration of George W. Bush
Simpson began working on her debut studio album in 1998. Her debut single, "I Wanna Love You Forever", was released on September 28, 1999.[18][19] The single became a success, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States.[20] The song earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales exceeding one million copies in the country.[21]
Simpson's debut studio album, Sweet Kisses, was released on November 23, 1999.[22] The album sold 65,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number sixty-five on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States.[23] The album also saw success in several European countries.[24][25] The following year, "Where You Are" was released as the second single from the album; Simpson's boyfriend Nick Lachey was featured on the track.[26] Simpson went on to announce her plans to remain abstinent until marriage.[27] "I Think I'm in Love with You" served as the album's third and final single and achieved success in the United States.[28] With the success of the album's third single, Sweet Kisses rose to a new peak of number twenty-five on the Billboard 200 in August 2000.[28] The album sold over two million copies in the United States, earning a double platinum certification from the RIAA.[29] Simpson embarked on the Heat It Up Tour with her boyfriend's band, 98 Degrees, as their opening act to promote Sweet Kisses throughout 2000.[30]
Work on her second album began in 2000; during the recording of the album, Simpson adopted a more mature public image.[31] In a July 2001, Simpson explained "I recorded [Sweet Kisses] when I was seventeen years old and I'm twenty-one [this month] so there is four years of growth involved."[32] While working on the record, Simpson ended her relationship with Lachey to focus on furthering her career; however, the two reconciled romantically that September.[30] Simpson released the record's title track, "Irresistible" as the lead single from the project in April 2001.[33] The single became her second top twenty hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[34][35] Simpson released her second studio album, Irresistible, on May 25, 2001.[36] The album sold 127,000 copies in the United States during its first week of release, debuting at number six on the Billboard 200 chart.[37] Though the album's first week sales nearly doubled those of her previous effort, Irresistible failed to match the success of her debut album; the record earned a gold certification from the RIAA for sales of 500,000 copies.[29] "A Little Bit", the album's second and final single, failed to achieve significant success. In July, Simpson began performing as a co-headliner on the Total Request Live Tour for the tour's first 14 dates, alongside artists such as Destiny's Child and Nelly.[38][39] On August 7, Simpson embarked on the DreamChaser Tour, a 15-date tour of North America.[40]

2002–2005: Marriage to Nick Lachey and heightened success[edit]
Simpson announced her engagement to Nick Lachey in February 2002,[41] with the two holding their wedding ceremony on October 26 in Austin, Texas.[42] Simpson also began working on her third studio album in 2002. On July 14, 2003, she released the album's lead single, "Sweetest Sin", but the song failed to achieve commercial success. Beginning in 2003, Simpson and Lachey began appearing in the MTV show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica.[43] The show premiered on August 19, 2003 and focused on the couple's marriage and the recording of Simpson's third studio album.[44][45] The show became a pop culture phenomenon instantly, with Simpson's perceived "dumb blonde" antics on the show helping to make the couple a household name.[46][47] The series was a ratings success for MTV and aired for three seasons until 2005.[47]

Simpson and then-husband Nick Lachey in 2005
Simpson released her third studio album, In This Skin on August 19, 2003. It was released the day that Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica premiered, with the show serving as a promotional tool for the record. In This Skin debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200, selling 64,000 copies in its first week of release.[48] The album's opening numbers served as the lowest of Simpson's career at the time, and by December 2003 had sold over 565,000 copies in the United States.[48] Simpson released "With You" as the second single from the album in October.[49] The single became a hit, reaching the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the Mainstream Top 40 chart based on radio airplay.[28] Simpson appeared in the halftime show of the Super Bowl XXXVIII. She recorded new material for a re-release of In This Skin, which was released in March 2004.[50][51][52] The re-release aided in album sales dramatically; In This Skin went on to sell three million copies in the United States.[53] In 2004 "Take My Breath Away" and "Angels" were released as singles from the re-release.[54]
Simpson and Lachey starred in the ABC special The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour in April, which featured guest appearances by celebrities such as Jewel and Mr. T, among others.[55] That same month, with Randi Shinder, she launched the cosmetics line Jessica Simpson Dessert Beauty; all of the products in the line were edible.[56][57] Simpson embarked on the North American Reality Tour beginning in June through October; the tour was a financial success.[58] During this time, Simpson and her husband began making guest appearances on The Ashlee Simpson Show, chronicling the start of Jessica's sister's music career.[59] Simpson's fourth studio album, a collection of Christmas-themed songs titled ReJoyce: The Christmas Album, was released on November 23, 2004.[60] The album reached a peak of number fourteen on the Billboard 200, and was certified gold by the RIAA for sales exceeding 500,000 copies.[61] Also in 2004, Simpson filmed a sitcom pilot for ABC, which the network did not pick up.[62] In February 2005, Simpson and Shinder launched the Dessert Treats edible cosmetics line, similar to their prior line but targeted towards a younger audience. Following two lawsuits regarding copyright and accounting, both lines were discontinued.[56][63]
Simpson performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the Indy 500 in 2005.[64] Simpson launched The Jessica Simpson Collection in 2005, initially partnering with Tarrant Apparel Group to release the Princy and JS by Jessica Simpson clothing lines.[65] The company has continued to grow throughout the years, and in 2014 was reported to earn $1 billion in annual sales.[66] Simpson made her film debut as Daisy Duke in the film adaption of The Dukes of Hazzard (2005).[67] While the film was met with negative reviews from film critics generally, it grossed over $111 million worldwide.[68] To promote the film, Simpson recorded "These Boots Are Made For Walkin'", a cover of the Nancy Sinatra song with additional lyrics.[69] The song entered the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming one Simpson's most successful singles to date.[70] The music video, which featured Simpson in character as Daisy Duke, was controversial for featuring Simpson in "revealing" outfits and washing the General Lee car in her bikini.[71] In November 2005, Simpson and Lachey announced they were separating.[72] Simpson filed for divorce in December 2005, citing "irreconcilable differences."[73] Their divorce was publicized worldwide and finalized on June 30, 2006.[74]

2006–2009: A Public Affair, other movies, and Do You Know[edit]
Simpson began working on her fifth studio album in 2005. On March 28, 2006, Simpson announced that she had signed a new record agreement with Epic Records and would be departing from Columbia Records after having been with the label for seven years.[75] Simpson and stylist Ken Pavés launched a line of hair and beauty products on the Home Shopping Network in 2006.[76] On  June 29, 2006, Simpson released the single "A Public Affair".[77] The song peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, and earned a gold certification from the RIAA for sales exceeding 500,000 copies in the United States.[29] The single, an upbeat breakup song, was released the day before her divorce from Lachey was finalized.[77]

Simpson in June 2008
On August 26, 2006, Simpson released her fifth studio album, A Public Affair. It debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 101,000 copies.[28] The album failed to match the success of In This Skin (2003), selling just over 500,000 copies in the United States.[29] The empowerment anthem "I Belong to Me", which served as the album's second and final single, failed to achieve commercial success.[78] Simpson starred alongside Dane Cook and Dax Shepard in the comedy film Employee of the Month, released that October.[79] The film received a negative critical reaction and failed to achieve commercial success.[80] Simpson performed a cover of the Dolly Parton song "9 to 5" as a tribute to the artist at the Kennedy Center Awards in December 2006, though her performance was cut from the broadcast.[81][82]
Simpson had an on-again, off-again relationship with singer-songwriter John Mayer from August 2006 to May 2007.[83][84] Simpson described her relationship with Mayer in her 2020 memoir, Open Book.[83] In November 2007, Simpson began dating Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. Cowboys fans considered the relationship controversial, as some blamed Simpson for Romo's poor performance in games after the pair got together. Some fans dubbed Simpson "Yoko Romo," a reference to Yoko Ono, to whom many fans of The Beatles attributed the quartet disbanding in 1970.[85] Even then-president George W. Bush commented on the pair's relationship, blaming Simpson implicitly for Romo's lackluster performances.[86] Simpson and Romo ended their relationship in July 2009.[87] Simpson also appeared alongside Luke Wilson in the film Blonde Ambition (2007); it had a limited release in Texas before being released on home media.[88] Later, she starred in the direct-to-video film Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous (2008), portraying an actress who joins the military. The film received a negative reaction overwhelmingly upon its release.[89] Simpson collaborated with Parlux Fragrances to launch her first scent, Fancy, in 2008. The fragrance received a positive commercial reaction.[90]
Simpson began working on her sixth studio album, a country music inspired record, in 2007.[91] Simpson claimed to have grown up around country music, and wanted to "give something back."[92] She released "Come On Over" as the project's lead single on June 20, 2008.[93] The song debuted at number forty-one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, making it the highest debut for an artist's first entry on that chart.[94] Do You Know was released on September 9, 2008.[95] The project sold 65,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number four on the Billboard 200 chart.[96] The album has sold just over 200,000 copies in the United States as of 2012.[97] Simpson opened for country music group Rascal Flatts on their Bob That Head Tour from January to March 2009.[98]

2010–present: Motherhood, second marriage, and focus on business ventures[edit]
Simpson in May 2010
Simpson's VH1 documentary series, The Price of Beauty, began airing in March 2010. The series followed Simpson around the world, introducing viewers to the different perceptions of beauty in different cultures.[99][100][101] The premiere episode attracted one million viewers.[102][103] Simpson revealed that the series would return in 2011 with a format change, but these plans never came to fruition.[104] On October 12, 2010, Epic Records released the compilation Playlist: The Very Best of Jessica Simpson, the final release of her three-album contract with the label.[105] Simpson signed a new recording contract with eleveneleven and Primary Wave Music and released her Christmas-themed seventh studio album.  Happy Christmas on November 22.[106] It peaked at number 123 on the Billboard 200 chart.[107] Simpson began dating retired NFL tight end Eric Johnson in May 2010[108] and married July 2014 in Montecito, California.[109] The couple have three children: Maxwell Drew Johnson, born May 2012,[110][111][112] Ace Knute Johnson, born June 2013,[113] and Birdie Mae Johnson, born March 2019.[114]
In May 2012, Simpson appeared alongside Nicole Richie as a mentor on the NBC reality television series Fashion Star.[115] The series revolved around a group of designers who competed each week to create clothing; each week, the judges eliminated one contestant.[116] The series aired its second and final season in 2013.[117] Following Maxwell's birth, Simpson launched a maternity clothing line that year.[118] In August 2012, she released the perfume Vintage Bloom.[119] She introduced a bedroom decor line including bedding and draperies offered in a romantic bohemian style, with floral patterns.[120] In August 2014, Simpson released a signature fragrance named after her.[121]
Simpson confirmed in 2015 that she would begin working on a new album and said that she was working with Linda Perry on the project.[122][123][124] In August 2015, Simpson was a host on the HSN channel while promoting her products.[125] Simpson launched her Warm Up brand of workout clothing, available at retailers in the United States.[126] She expanded the brand in August 2016 to include trainers.[126]
On February 2, 2020, Simpson released her memoir Open Book, which topped The New York Times Best Seller list selling over 59,000 copies in its first week.[127][128] In the book, she discussed her marriage to Nick Lachey, her relationship with musician John Mayer, sexual abuse she experienced during her childhood, dependence on alcohol and prescription drugs, and body image issues.[128][83] Six new songs were released as part of the book, marking her first release of music since Happy Christmas in 2010.[128][129]

Musical style[edit]
Simpson has listed Whitney Houston,[130] Mariah Carey, Aretha Franklin and Sade as influences on her music.[131] She attempted to launch her career as a Christian music singer, and at one point completed a self-titled album of Christian music.[14] When she signed with Columbia Records in 1998, she began working on an album of pop music.[14] Simpson has recorded songs with Christian themes in later years, including "Pray Out Loud" (2008).[132] The music on her debut album consisted of pop ballads primarily, with the intention of showcasing Simpson's vocals.[133] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine opined that the album "position[ed] her as the teen Celine Dion".[134] It featured the power ballad "I Wanna Love You Forever" (1999).[135] The work drew comparisons to Mariah Carey.[30] With the release of Irresistible (2001), Simpson recorded more upbeat songs, likening herself to artists such as Britney Spears.[136][137] Songs such as "Irresistible" and "A Little Bit" had more provocative lyrics in comparison to her previous release, with Simpson citing the age difference between the recording of the two albums as the main reason.[31] During the Total Request Live Tour (2001) and her DreamChaser Tour (2001), Simpson incorporated more choreography and backup dancers into her live performances.[138]
Simpson began working on her third studio album in 2002 initially, on which rapper Missy Elliott would serve as the primary producer.[139] The record later took on a new direction, which her then-husband Nick Lachey described as "organic" in comparison to her two prior albums.[140] Simpson also began co-writing songs for the record, something she had been nervous to do in the past.[140] The result was In This Skin (2003), a record that AllMusic said "stay[ed] within the contemporary dance-pop realm while inching toward the middle-of-the-road diva that she's always yearned to be."[30] Simpson worked with elements of country music with the release of "These Boots Are Made For Walkin'" (2005), recorded for Simpson's feature film debut The Dukes of Hazzard (2005).[141] She continued to experiment with the genre on the song "Push Your Tush" (2006). Numerous songs on her fifth studio album feature elements of dance and disco music, including "A Public Affair" and her cover of "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)".[142][143] Inspired by artists such as Faith Hill, Shania Twain, and Martina McBride, Simpson recorded a country music album titled Do You Know (2008).[144] Throughout her career, Simpson has delved into other genres as well, releasing Christmas-themed albums in 2004 and 2010, respectively.[145]

Public image[edit]
Simpson in October 2006
Simpson came to prominence as a teen idol in the late 1990s and the media described her as Columbia Records's "blond response to Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera", who had achieved recent success with their respective debut albums.[146][134] Her debut album, Sweet Kisses (1999) mostly explores themes such as love,[134] and Simpson announced that she would remain abstinent until marriage.[1][147] She went through a "carefully orchestrated sexy makeover" while she promoted her second album, Irresistible (2001).[147] Simpson later described Columbia's record executive Tommy Mottola as abusive, as he attempted to control her image and told her to "lose fifteen pounds" after she signed her contract in 1997.[146]
Upon Simpson's rise to stardom with the success of Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica in 2003, media critics and the public perceived her as a "ditzy blonde" based on her antics and comments on the show.[148][149][150] The Washington Post's Emily Yahr called her "one of our first reality TV stars, before anyone could absorb the psychological damage it could cause."[146] Simpson recalled her time in the show in her 2020 memoir Open Book, saying: "Nowadays, I see so many people performing their identities on social media, but I feel like I was a guinea pig for that. How was I supposed to live a real, healthy life filtered through the lens of a reality show? If my personal life was my work, and my work required me to play a certain role, who even was I anymore?"[146]
The media also described her as a sex symbol.[151] Simpson's portrayal of Daisy Duke furthered her sex symbol image,[152] and she portrayed the character in her "These Boots Are Made For Walkin" music video, which presents "footage of Simpson writhing suggestively against a suds-soaked motor vehicle."[153] The scene was parodied in Pink's "Stupid Girls" music video.[154] Simpson also appeared as Daisy Duke in several television commercials for Pizza Hut airing during[155] the Super Bowl in 2006 and 2007.[156] Simpson claimed that the "[Daisy Duke] role created a "gold standard" that she would be judged by in the years that followed",[152] and the media scrutinized her intensely following her weight gain in 2009.[157][158]
Simpson endorsed George W. Bush during his presidential campaign in 2004,[159] though she canceled an appearance at a 2006 Republican fundraiser as she felt it was not "appropriate".[160] Simpson praised former First Lady Michelle Obama during her husband's time in office, stating, "She's such an incredible woman, and she's with such a powerful man...Everything she does she exudes confidence."[161]
In April 2004, Simpson performed in VH1's benefit concert Divas Live 2004 alongside Ashanti, Cyndi Lauper, Gladys Knight, Joss Stone and Patti LaBelle to support the Save the Music Foundation.[162] In May 2004, Simpson did a benefit concert to aid the Skin Care Foundation.[163] In March 2007, Simpson donated a new Chrysler minivan to the Elim orphanage in Nuevo Laredo. Simpson is Soles4Souls's Ambassador and participated in autographing shoes to donate the money from communities across the United States.[164] Simpson also works with Make-A-Wish Foundation.[165]
