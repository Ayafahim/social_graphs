Megan Ann Moroney (born October 9, 1997) is an American country music singer and songwriter from Douglasville, Georgia. She charted her second single, "Tennessee Orange", in 2022. Her debut album Lucky was released in May 2023, reaching the top 40 of the Billboard 200.[2] She released her second album, Am I Okay?, in summer 2024. The first promotional single off the album, "Am I Okay", charted in the US.


Biography[edit]
Moroney was born October 9, 1997, in Savannah, Georgia.[1][3][4]
She began listening to country music in her childhood and learned to play piano. Moroney went to Robert S. Alexander High School and participated in cheerleading and musical theater. While attending the University of Georgia, she opened at a concert for Jon Langston, as well as interned for Kristian Bush of Sugarland. Megan now writes/co-writes all of her own music.[5] At the university, she was in the Kappa Delta sorority.[2] After completing her degree, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2020 to begin a music career. She kept in contact with Bush, which led to him introducing her to other songwriters. She released her first single "Wonder" in 2021, which in turn led to her releasing an extended play titled Pistol Made of Roses. Her next single release was "Tennessee Orange" in 2022, a track on which Bush served as producer.[1]
After the song's release, Moroney received attention on social media for wearing a Tennessee Volunteers shirt belonging to Morgan Wallen; it led to rumors that she was dating him, but Moroney remained neutral when asked if the two were in a relationship. After the song became popular through online streaming, Moroney signed with Arista Nashville.[6]
In late 2022, "Tennessee Orange" debuted at number 94 on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Moroney her first chart entry. At the time, the song also charted on Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay.[7] Arista Nashville closed while the song was climbing the charts, and as a result, Moroney was transferred to Columbia Records Nashville.[8]
On May 5, 2023, Moroney released her debut album Lucky.[9] The album featured the singles "Tennessee Orange" and "I'm Not Pretty". The album reached the top 40 of the Billboard 200. The album was named as the Best Country and American album of 2023 by Rolling Stone with writer Jonathan Bernstein saying the Moroney created a 'casual, youth-conversant tone makes it shine and comes naturally'.[10] A deluxe version of the album was released on the 22nd of September.[11]
Moroney released a cover version of Chris Stapleton's 2013 single "What Are You Listening To?" as an Amazon Music exclusive on October 6, 2023.[12] The song was released on other streaming platforms in January 2024.
Since then, she has released a song with Old Dominion titled "Can't Break Up Now", a single "No Caller ID", and the deluxe version of her debut album Lucky.
On May 2, 2024, Moroney announced her second album Am I Okay? It was released on July 12, 2024.[13]
