Early life[edit]
Kacey Lee Musgraves was born August 21, 1988, [8][9][10][11] in Golden, Texas,[12] to Karen (née Abrams), an artist, and Craig Musgraves, owner of a small printing business, M-Prints Printing, Inc., in Mineola, Texas. Musgraves has said she was born six weeks prematurely and weighed only five pounds. Musgraves has a younger sister, Kelly Christine Sutton (née Musgraves), who is a photographer.[13][14][15][16][17][18]
Musgraves started writing songs at age eight. Her first was a song for her elementary-school graduation, "Notice Me".[17] She first learned to play music on the mandolin, then at age 12 started taking guitar lessons from a local musician named John DeFoore, which she later described as "one of the most important things that ever happened to me."[17] She also learned harmonica.[19]
Musgraves' mother took her to local music festivals to sing western swing music.[20] She and co-student Alina Tatum formed country-music duo Texas Two Bits, toured through Texas, and released an independent album in 2000,[21] and earned an invitation to perform at President George W. Bush's "Black Tie and Boots Inaugural Ball".[22] Musgraves also won yodeling national championships[19] and was selected to sing the national anthem at the 2002 Winter Olympics.[23] At age 14, her family funded her first solo, self-released album.[17] She graduated from Mineola High School in 2006 and moved to Austin, Texas, at 18.[17] In 2007, Musgraves competed on Season 5 of the singing competition reality TV series Nashville Star, where she placed seventh.[24][25] To sustain herself she took various jobs, including performing as Hannah Montana for children's birthday parties.[26]

Artistry[edit]

Influences[edit]
Musgraves lists Alison Krauss as one of her career role models, stating, "I mean, how many Grammys does she have? She's just remained solid and true and great, and I respect that".[99]
Musgraves' favorite artist is John Prine and, in a tribute performance to him following his death in 2020, she stated that "my favorite quality of John's would be his sense of humor and it really influenced my songwriting a lot" and proclaimed "that man singlehandedly influenced me and my songwriting more than anyone else on this planet".[100][101] Musgraves also lists Lee Ann Womack as one of her childhood influences: "Lee Ann Womack is from near where I grew up in East Texas, so I've always looked up to her."[102] Speaking of both Prine and Womack, Musgraves stated, "if I could sing it like Lee Ann would and say it like John would, then I feel like I've gotten somewhere".
Of her sophomore album, Musgraves listed albums by Glen Campbell, Bobbie Gentry, Marty Robbins, Charley Pride, Roger Miller, and Jim Croce as influences[103] and an interview with Rolling Stone Country cited Ray Price, Julie Miller, and Loretta Lynn.[104]
In a Billboard interview, Musgraves said that she is a Dolly Parton fan, saying "Beauty, sex appeal, brains, wit, humor, beautiful songwriting, meaningful songwriting, no apologies for who she is, LGBTQ advocate long before it was even a thing or trendy or whatever... She's fearless and I admire her spirit a lot and she's very kind. She's very present when you're talking to her and I just really love her so much."[105]
Noncountry artists whom Musgraves has mentioned as influences include Cher, Selena,[106] Ryan Adams, Cake, Neil Young, Weezer, Imogen Heap, Bee Gees, Sade, and Electric Light Orchestra.[107]

Lyrical themes and style[edit]
Critics have described Musgraves as a soprano.[108][109][110] Musgraves' socially progressive lyrics draw attention in the generally conservative country music genre.[111] Her music has tackled topics such as LGBT acceptance, safe sexual intercourse, recreational marijuana use, and questioning religious sentiment.[112]
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Musgraves talked about criticism she faced for her rebellious lyrics. "I think throwing the rebel card out there is really cheap," she said. "The things I'm singing about are not controversial to me, I don't push buttons to push buttons. I talk about things that have made an impression on me that a lot of people everywhere are going through."[113]

Personal life[edit]
In 2014, in an interview with ABC Radio, Musgraves said she had been in a relationship with her bandmate Misa Arriaga for several years after becoming friends first.[114]
Musgraves met Ruston Kelly at the Bluebird Café in Nashville. In May 2016, they had a songwriting date, and they began dating shortly after. Musgraves stated that the song "Butterflies" from her album Golden Hour is about her courtship with Kelly.[14][115] On December 24, 2016, Musgraves became engaged to Kelly.[116] They married on October 14, 2017, in Tennessee.[117] The couple filed for divorce in July 2020,[118] which was finalized in September 2020.[119] From 2021 to 2023, Musgraves was in a relationship with poet Cole Schafer.[120]
