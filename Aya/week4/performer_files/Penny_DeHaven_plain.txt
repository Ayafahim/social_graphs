Charlotte "Penny" DeHaven (May 17, 1948[1] – February 23, 2014)[2] was an American country and gospel music singer. At the beginning of her career, she recorded as Penny Starr.[1]

Her albums included 1972's Penny DeHaven and 2011's gospel collection A Penny Saved.[2]
As an actress, she made two guest appearances on the CBS-TV/syndicated TV show Hee Haw in 1972–73.  She also appeared in the movies Traveling Light, Country Music Story,[1] the 1973 horror movie Valley of Blood, and the 1974 TV series Funny Farm.
