Cory Morrow (born May 1, 1972, in Houston, Texas) is a Texas Country singer-songwriter who has gained popularity throughout the Southwest.[1]


Biography[edit]
Morrow was born May 1, 1972, in Houston, Texas. He started playing guitar at Memorial High School in Houston and continued to develop as a musician while attending Texas Tech University, where he was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.[citation needed]
In 1993, Morrow moved to Austin, Texas, to pursue music as a career. He is also considered part of the Red Dirt music scene, that differentiates itself from the popular Nashville music scene. Morrow has sold over 200,000 albums independently. Morrow's 2002 release Outside the Lines reached No. 28 on Billboard's Country Album chart, No. 3 on the magazine's Internet Sales chart, No. 8 on its Independent Album chart and No. 16 on Heatseekers chart. SoundScan ranked him No. 7 among "country debut artists" that year.[2]
