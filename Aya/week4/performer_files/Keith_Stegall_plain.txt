Robert Keith Stegall (born November 1, 1955[2]) is an American country music recording artist and record producer. Active since 1980, Stegall has recorded two major-label studio albums: 1985's Keith Stegall and 1996's Passages, although he is mainly known for his production work.


Musical career[edit]
Robert Keith Stegall was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, in 1955. He performed in local bands, spent a short time in northwestern Louisiana (in the mid-1970s) where he operated a small-time music recording business, then moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the persuasion of Kris Kristofferson.[3]
Stegall charted thirteen singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, with the highest-peaking being 1985's "Pretty Lady", a No. 10 hit.[2] Starting in the late 1980s, Stegall has been active primarily as a record producer for several recording acts, most notably Alan Jackson, George Jones, Zac Brown Band, and Clay Walker.[2] Stegall has also written several of Jackson's singles, as well as George Strait's Number one hit "I Hate Everything" and Dr. Hook's "Sexy Eyes".
In 2008, Stegall co-founded the label Bigger Picture Music Group.[4] The label closed in 2014.
In 2016, Stegall launched a Nashville-based production, management, and publishing firm, Dreamlined Entertainment Group, with Scott Miller of Miller Investment Management.[5]
In October 2017, Fangate Music, a label run by Australian country music promoter Rob Potts, in conjunction with Sony Music Australia, announced their partnership with Stegall's Dreamlined Entertainment Group.[6]
