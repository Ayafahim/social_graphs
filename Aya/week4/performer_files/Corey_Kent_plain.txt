Corey Kent White (born June 21, 1994) is an American country music singer from Frisco, Texas signed to RCA Nashville.


Biography[edit]
Corey Kent White was born in Bixby, Oklahoma. Kent grew up listening to country music, taking influence from artists such as fellow Oklahoma native Garth Brooks. Learning the road life early, Kent was just 11 when he joined a touring Western Swing group, traveling the country at the front of a “working class” band brothers for five years before they finally dissolved.[1] Still in high school and unsure of what came next, he nearly quit entirely – but after a chance encounter of being pulled out of the audience and joining Willie Nelson on stage, he was inspired to start writing songs, a new path emerged. At age 17, he moved to Tennessee, hit the pavement and scored a publishing deal. And then the bottom dropped out.  He lost his publishing deal, decided to move back to Texas and then epidemic happened[2]
As the world started opening up, Corey began touring in Texas and Oklahoma[3] playing in night clubs and opening for bands like Randy Rogers, Parker McCollum, Kolby Cooper and Cody Johnson. Corey then emerged on to the Billboard charts in 2022 with "Wild as Her". Due to popularity on streaming services, the song charted in late 2022. The song is a follow-up to Kent's second studio album, 21.[4] Because of this song's initial charting success, Billboard reported that many Nashville labels were in a bidding war to sign Kent.[5] RCA Records Nashville signed Kent in August 2022 and began promoting "Wild as Her" to country radio.[6] "Wild as Her" amassed over 300 million streams in its first year, reached platinum status in March 2023 and reached the top spot at Country Radio in May of the same year.[7]
Kent's major label debut and third studio album, Blacktop, was released on June 2, 2023 via RCA Nashville. "Something's Gonna Kill Me" was released on July 10, 2023 as the second single.[8]
