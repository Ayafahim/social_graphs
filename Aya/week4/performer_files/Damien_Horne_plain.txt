     "I have never met a more important artist for our times, completely real, unique, deserving and uplifting. I cannot stop until the world hears his music. He writes, he sings , he plays piano and guitar, he dances like 'the man' and you know it when he backflips off the stage in a way that would make James Brown proud."[5]
Horne signed a publishing deal with Big Love Music in 2007.[3][6]
He has made appearances on One Cubed,[7] The 700 Club,[8][9] and Legends & Lyrics,[4] as well as appeared in Rolling Stone and on the cover of Lifeway Christian Singles magazine.[10][11]
