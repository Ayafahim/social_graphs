Early life[edit]
Grimes was born in Dayton, Ohio, the son of a Pentecostal pastor.[3] Grimes graduated from Dayton Christian High School in 2002.[citation needed] He moved to New York City to study acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.[citation needed]

Career[edit]
Grimes has appeared in All the Boys Love Mandy Lane, War Eagle, Arkansas, and Assassination of a High School President, which received a limited release in March 2009.

Grimes portrayed vampire James Kent in True Blood for six episodes during the show's sixth season, but later left the show and was replaced by Nathan Parsons.
