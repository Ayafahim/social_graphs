Kelsea Nicole Ballerini (born September 12, 1993) is an American country pop singer and songwriter. A four-time Grammy Award nominee, she has gained success since the 2010s, being honored with the Gene Weed Milestone Award at the Academy of Country Music Awards and the Rising Star Award at the Billboard Women in Music.
She began songwriting as a child and signed a contract with Black River Entertainment in 2014,[4] releasing her debut studio album, The First Time, and her second one Unapologetically, followed in 2017.[5] The two albums account for seven songs on the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts. She has five No. 1 singles on the latter, starting with her debut single "Love Me Like You Mean It", which made her the first female artist to send a debut single to the top of that chart since Carrie Underwood in 2006. It was followed by "Dibs" and "Peter Pan", whose peaks also made her the first female country artist to send her first three singles to the top of that chart since Wynonna Judd. 
Her third studio album, Kelsea, and a counterpart acoustic album, Ballerini, were both released in 2020. The collaboration "Half of My Hometown" with Kenny Chesney garnered two Country Music Association Awards. Her fourth studio album, Subject to Change was released in 2022.


Early life[edit]
Ballerini, an only child, grew up in Knoxville, Tennessee[2] with her father Ed[6][7] and her mother Carla. Ed was a sales manager at a country radio station and is of Italian descent. Carla has worked in marketing for the Bible publishing division of Thomas Nelson and a sponsorship company.[7] Kelsea started taking dance lessons at Premiere Dance Studio in Seymour, Tennessee when she was three and quit ten years later.[8] She also sang in a church choir and the school choir.[6] She wrote her first song at 12 for her mother[9] and moved to Nashville three years later.[2] She attended Central High School in Knoxville, Tennessee; Centennial High School in Franklin, Tennessee; and Lipscomb University for two years until pursuing a musical career.[10]

Career[edit]
2014–2016: Self-titled EP and The First Time[edit]
Ballerini in 2014
At 19, Kelsea Ballerini signed a deal with Black River Entertainment.[2] In late 2014, she released her debut single "Love Me Like You Mean It", which debuted on the Country Airplay chart in October 2014.[11] She released a self-titled extended play for the label in November.[12] She was named one of CMT's Next Women of Country in 2014. She performed for the first time at the Grand Ole Opry on February 14, 2015, and sang "Love Me Like You Mean It."[6] On May 19, 2015, Ballerini's debut album The First Time was released through Black River. For the chart dated July 4, 2015, "Love Me Like You Mean It," the album's first single, reached number one on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, making Ballerini the first solo female country music artist to score a number one hit with her debut single since Carrie Underwood did so with "Jesus, Take the Wheel" in 2006, and only the eleventh in history to achieve the feat.[13] Ballerini also became only the fifth solo female country music artist to score back-to-back number one hits with her first two singles when "Dibs" reached the top of the Country Airplay chart and the first to do it since Jamie O'Neal in 2001.[14]
The album's third single, "Peter Pan," was released to country radio on March 21, 2016. "Peter Pan" reached number one on both the Country Airplay and Hot Country Songs charts in September, making Ballerini the first solo female country music artist to top both country music charts simultaneously.[15] The achievement made her the first solo female to send her first three singles to number one since Wynonna Judd accomplished the same feat in 1992.[15] The album's fourth single, "Yeah Boy," was released to country radio on October 10, 2016.

2017–2019: Unapologetically, coaching The Voice, and joining the Grand Ole Opry[edit]

The second single from the album, "I Hate Love Songs", was released in March.[22] In September 2018, she announced that she would be releasing a deluxe edition of the album with four new tracks.[23] On September 18, 2018, EDM-pop duo The Chainsmokers released a song titled "This Feeling" featuring Ballerini, which later performed at the 2018 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in November.[24] The third and final single from Unapologetically, "Miss Me More," was released in October 2018.[25] In October, she provided vocals on her husband Morgan Evans' song "Dance With Me."[26] Ballerini joined the 15th season of The Voice as the fifth coach, where she coached six contestants who did not get a chair turn during The Blinds, in a new round called The Comeback Stage, a digital companion series to the show.[27] In October 2018, Ballerini released the song "We Were Like."[28] In December 2018, Unapologetically received a nomination for Best Country Album at the 61st annual Grammy Awards.[29]

In July 2019, Ballerini confirmed in an Instagram post that work on her third studio album was complete.[34] On September 6, 2019, Ballerini released the first single off of her then upcoming third album, titled "Homecoming Queen?"[35] The song debuted at number 22 on the Country Airplay chart, making it Ballerini's highest debut on the chart to date.[36] On November 8, Ballerini released the promotional single "Club".[37] Ballerini confirmed on January 20, 2020, that the album is self-titled (Kelsea) and was released March 20, 2020.[38] The announcement coincided with the release of a second promotional single, "LA".[38] On February 28, she released the single "Hole in the Bottle" (stylized in all lowercase) and announced the tracklist for Kelsea, including "Half of My Hometown" featuring Kenny Chesney and "The Other Girl" featuring Halsey.[39]
On September 2, Ballerini announced she would be releasing a counterpart album to Kelsea, titled Ballerini, featuring stripped-down versions of the songs. It was released on September 11, 2020. The stripped-down version of "Club" was released alongside the album announcement.[40] She described Ballerini as "emotional, vulnerable and soft" while Kelsea showed her "bold and effervescent" side.[41] As of October 16, 2020, Kelsea and Ballerini can be purchased physically as a double album, exclusively from Target.[42]
In 2021, Ballerini temporarily filled in for Kelly Clarkson as a coach during Season 20 of The Voice.[43] She co-hosted the 2021 CMT Music Awards with Kane Brown, where she won the award for CMT Performance of the Year. In May, it was announced she would be an opening act on the Jonas Brothers' Remember This tour which began in August.[44] Her debut book of poetry, Feel Your Way Through, was released on November 16, 2021.[45]

2022–2024: Subject to Change, Rolling Up the Welcome Mat, and The Voice[edit]
In March 2022 Ballerini announced that "Heartfirst" would be released April 8, 2022. The song serves as the first single from her fourth studio album, Subject to Change.[46] While co-hosting during the 2022 CMT Music Awards, Ballerini performed the song for the first time.[47] The music video for the song premiered July 7, 2022.[48] On July 15, 2022, a promotional single, "Love is a Cowboy" was released along with the official music video.[48] The album features a collaboration, "You're Drunk, Go Home", with Kelly Clarkson and Carly Pearce. The album was released on September 23, 2022.[49][50] In November 2022, "Heartfirst" was nominated for Best Country Solo Performance at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards.[51] On December 5, 2022, "If You Go Down (I'm Goin' Down Too)", was released as the album's second single.

On August 8, 2024, Ballerini announced her fifth studio album Patterns, and that the song "Sorry Mom" would be released the following day. The album will be released on October 25, 2024.[55]

Influences[edit]
Ballerini has been influenced by artists in both the pop music and country music fields. Originally influenced by pop music, Ballerini states "I grew up on top 40 pop. I didn't know what country music was, which is so funny because I grew up in East Tennessee."[56] Ballerini lists Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, NSYNC, and Hilary Duff among these early artists influencing her.[57][58] Ballerini also cites Justin Bieber as an early pop musical inspiration.[59] It was not until Ballerini heard "Stupid Boy" by Keith Urban that she decided to delve deeper into country music by listening to albums by Taylor Swift, Sugarland, and Dixie Chicks. She credited Swift's self-titled debut studio album for introducing her to country music. Ballerini also cites Shania Twain as her greatest influence.[60] She has also performed songs originally recorded by Alison Krauss and sang "Ghost in This House" alongside Krauss at the CMT Artists of the Year Awards in 2018.[61][62]

Personal life[edit]

In February 2023, it was confirmed that Ballerini was dating Outer Banks actor Chase Stokes. The couple reportedly began dating in December 2022.[68][69]
Ballerini was a student at Central High School during the 2008 shooting, which she witnessed. She has said she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder due to the experience.[70]
