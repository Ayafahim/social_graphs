Biography[edit]
Haskell Burl Watson was born July 10, 1953, in Tyler, Texas, and raised in La Porte, Texas. His nickname "B. B." stood for "Bad Boy".[1] Watson spent his teenage and young adult years working as a musician throughout Texas before moving to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1991 to begin a music career. That same year, he was the first act signed to BNA Records, then a new label division of RCA Records Nashville. His debut single "Light at the End of the Tunnel" was the label's first charted single, entering Billboard Hot Country Songs in mid-1991.[2] The song peaked at number 23 that year. Another single, "Lover Not a Fighter", peaked at number 43. Both songs were included on his only BNA album, also titled Light at the End of the Tunnel.[1] Nick Cristiano of The Philadelphia Inquirer rated the album three out of four stars, comparing Watson's style favorably to Merle Haggard.[3] Michael McCall of Country Music magazine praised the album's honky-tonk sound and Watson's "big voice".[4]
His only other release was 2001's Delta Dream, which charted the single "The Memory Is the Last Thing to Go" that year.[1] Watson died in Baytown, Texas, on September 28, 2013.[5]
