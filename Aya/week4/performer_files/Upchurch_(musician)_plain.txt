Ryan Edward Upchurch (born May 24, 1991), known as Upchurch, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, and comedian from Cheatham County, on the outskirts of Nashville. Upchurch became popular primarily as a comedian, creating videos on various platforms to garner support and fans. He sold merchandise and coined the phrase "raise hell and eat cornbread". Originally considered a "country rapper", Ryan Upchurch has diversified into many genres including rap, rock, and country.[1]


Career[edit]
Upchurch began uploading videos to YouTube.[1] He released an extended play, Cheatham County, in 2015, followed by a full-length album, Heart of America, in 2016.[1] Both releases reached the top 30 of the Billboard Top Country Albums chart.[2] Heart of America sold 1,300 copies in its first week of release.[3]
The second full-length album, Chicken Willie, was released in August 2016. It reached No. 22 on Billboard's Top Country Albums and No. 11 on the Rap Albums charts, selling 2,800 copies in the first week.[4] In 2017, Upchurch released another EP titled Summer Love, which is completely country-oriented, with no elements of rap music; and another studio album titled Son of the South. Summer Love, debuted at No. 33 in the Top Country Albums chart with  3,700 copies sold, while Son of the South debuted at No. 29 with 48,100 copies sold.[5]
Upchurch's fifth studio album, King of Dixie, was released on November 10, 2017, and features 19 tracks. Upchurch's first rock album, Creeker, was released on April 20 which was focused on rock with few rap elements. His August 2018 release, Supernatural, a rap-focused album with some country elements, peaked at No. 6 on Billboard's Top Country Albums. His December 2018 album, River Rat, peaked at No. 22.
Upchurch released his next album, Creeker II in April 2019. Later that year, he released Parachute on September 24, followed by a collaboration album with Adam Calhoun entitled Hooligan on November 25.
