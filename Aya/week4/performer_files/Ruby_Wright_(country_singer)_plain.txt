Ruby Wright (October 27, 1939 – September 27, 2009)[1] was an American country music singer-songwriter. Wright was the daughter of country singers Kitty Wells and Johnnie Wright.[1] She sang with her parents as a young girl and at age 13, was signed by RCA Records as Ruby Wells because there was also a Ruby Wright who was a pop singer.[2]
In the mid-1950s, she became part of an all-girl trio, 'Nita, Rita and Ruby.[3] The Nita of the trio was Anita Carter of the well-known Carter Family.[1][4] Working with Chet Atkins, the young singers enjoyed some success on record.[5] Strictly a recording group, they did not make personal appearances or tours; Rita had a problem with stage fright which eventually meant the break-up of the trio.[2] After the trio disbanded, Ruby began singing with her sister, Carol Sue, as The Wright Sisters.  They were signed to a recording contract by Cadence Records also under the direction of Chet Atkins.[2][6] Ruby also made some recordings as Ruby Wells with her father and uncle as Johnnie and Jack and Ruby.[7] Her most successful single was "Dern Ya", an answer to Roger Miller's "Dang Me".[1][2]
She signed with Epic Records in 1966.[8] Wright recorded for Plantation Records and Scorpion Records, as well as other small labels during the 1970s.[2]
Wright died of heart-related illness on September 27, 2009, at age 69.[1][9] Her father, Johnnie, died two years later to the day.[10]
