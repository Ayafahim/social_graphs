Brown & Gray is a British/American country-pop duo based in London and Los Angeles. The duo is composed of singer/songwriters Kaci Brown and Sam Gray.


History[edit]
Brown & Gray performing at Stagecoach 2018 on the SiriusXM Spotlight stage.
Sam and Kaci first started working together as Brown & Gray after Gray wrote a country song, but wasn't satisfied with the vocals. Management at Notting Hill Music brought Brown into the project, and the song developed into what is known today as "Top Down".[1] "Top Down" was released in mid-2017, and was soon featured substantially by Apple Music and Radio Disney Country.[2] Since September 2017, the video for "Top Down" has garnered over 860k views on YouTube.[3] That same month, SiriusXM's country music station, The Highway, named Brown & Gray as a Highway Find Artist.[4]
Brown & Gray also performed a number of shows as part of The Highway Finds Tour: Fall 2017.[5][6] In early 2018, CMT chose to select Brown & Gray as part of their CMT Discovery Artist program.[7] In April 2018, Brown & Gray performed at Stagecoach in Indio, CA on the SiriusXM Spotlight Stage.[8]
