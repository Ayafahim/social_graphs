Biography[edit]
Early years[edit]
Stephenson learned how to play the mandolin as a young boy. At age 13, he recorded a 45 rpm single with his interpretation of the Osborne Brothers' Rocky Top" on one side and Jim & Jesse's "Somebody Loves You Darling" on the flip side.[2]
Stephenson started touring with his father Ed Stephenson in the mid 1970s in Larry Stephenson & the New Grass. He also toured with Cliff Waldron and Leon Morris. Starting in 1979, he toured with Bill Harrell and the Virginians for more than four years. In 1983, he joined the Bluegrass Cardinals.[2][3]
During this time, he recorded two solo albums: Sweet Sunny South in 1982 and Every Time I Sing A Love Song. He moved close to Nashville in April 1992.[2]

The Larry Stephenson Band[edit]
Stephenson formed the band February 10, 1989. Initially, Marc Keller played guitar, Doug Campbell played bass, and, Rick Allred played banjo. The current lineup is Derek Vaden (banjo), Matt Downing (guitar), and Norbert McGettigan (bass).

White House[edit]
White House was a bluegrass supergroup formed by Stephenson, David Parmley (guitar, lead vocals), Missy Raines (bass), Jason Carter (violin), and Charlie Cushman (banjo). All members are or were residents of White House, Tennessee. They released one album, White House, in 2003.[4]

The Bluegrass Band[edit]
The Bluegrass Band was formed in 1972 by Butch Robins, but disbanded one year later. The band started up again in 1989, this time with members Wayne Henderson (guitar), Ronnie Simpkins (bass), Wyatt Rice (guitar), Arnie Solomon (mandolin), Robins (banjo), Rickie Simpkins (violin, mandolin, vocals), and Stephenson (mandolin, vocals). They recorded four albums that were sold via telemarketing: Once Again From the Top volumes 1 and 2 were traditional bluegrass, and Shine Hallelujah Shine volumes 2 and 2 were traditional gospel.[5][6]

Whysper Dream Music[edit]
Stephenson and his wife Dreama run their own record label Whysper Dream Music, named after their daughter Falon Whysper. They started the label when Pinecastle temporarily went out of business.[2][7]
