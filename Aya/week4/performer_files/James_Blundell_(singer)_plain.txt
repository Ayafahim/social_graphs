James Blundell (born 8 December 1964) is an Australian country music singer. Born in Stanthorpe, Queensland, Blundell first rose to prominence after being named "best new talent" at the 1987 Country Music Awards of Australia. Blundell has since released several albums in both Australia and the United States, with his most successful album This Road (released in 1992) selling more than 145,000 copies in Australia. Blundell was an unsuccessful candidate for the Senate in Queensland at the 2013 federal election, running for Katter's Australian Party. At the 2019 Country Music Awards of Australia, Blundell was inducted into the Hall of Fame.


Early life[edit]
Blundell was born in Queensland town of Stanthorpe, and was brought up on a sheep and cattle station near the town. As an adult he worked as a station hand across various locations in northern Australia. After a back injury sustained while working on a farm in Papua New Guinea he turned to music.[1][2][3]

Main articles: This Road (album), Touch of Water, Earth & Sea, and I Shall Be Released: The Best of James Blundell
In March 1992, Blundell released a cover of The Dingoes' song "Way Out West" with James Reyne. The song was a commercial success peaking at number 2 on the ARIA Charts and was certified gold.[7] It won Blundell his first APRA Award for Country Song of the Year. In April, Blundell released his third studio album This Road which peaked at number 4 on the ARIA Charts, was certified platinum and has sold more than 145,000 copies in Australia.[8] Additional singles "This Road" and "Down on the Farm" were released in 1992 and Blundell won two more Golden Guitar awards at the 1993 CMAA, including Top Selling album of the Year. In August 1993, Blundell released Touch of Water which peaked at number 11 on the ARIA Charts. Blundell continued to play regularly at folk and country music festivals around Australia. In April 1995, Blundell released his fifth studio album Earth & Sea which peaked at number 31. In 1996, disillusioned with the music industry, around Europe in a van, earning money by busking.[8]
In 1997, Blundell featured in a Qantas commercial, singing "I Still Call Australia Home", and in the lead-up to the 1999 Australian republic referendum, Blundell recorded the official song for the "No" campaign, despite being in favour of a republic.[9][10][11] In 1999, Blundell released his sixth studio album Amsterdam Breakfast which sold 8,000 copies.[8] In August 2001, EMI released his first greatest hits album, I Shall Be Released: The Best of James Blundell, which concluded his record deal.

2003–2012: Independent Artist, CMAA Hands of Fame and CMC Hall of Fame[edit]
As an independent artist, Blundell garnered media attention for his 2003 song "Postcards from Saigon", speaking out against the war in Iraq.[12][8] In 2005, the song won Australian Independent Country Music Single of the Year and Independent Country Music Male Vocalist of the Year. In 2005, Blundell released Deluge, followed by Ring Around the Moon in 2007 and Portrait of a Man in 2008.

In March 2012, Blundell was the inaugural inductee into the Country Music Channel's Hall of Fame.[17]

2013–present: politics and music[edit]
Main article: Campfire (James Blundell album)
In June 2013, Blundell became a candidate in the 2013 Australian federal election. In August 2015, Blundell released Come on In and in February 2017, his twelfth studio album Campfire which became his first charting album in over 20 years, peaking at number 58. In February 2018, a tribute album 30 Years of Pride: A Tribute to James Blundell was released.

Politics[edit]
In June 2013, Blundell was selected as Katter's Australian Party's lead Senate candidate[18][19] for Queensland in the 2013 federal election.[20] This was largely at the urging of Bob Katter, the party's founder and only federal member of parliament. Blundell had previously been approached to stand in elections by the Liberal National Party (LNP), but declined.[21] His selection was controversial within the party, in part because he had not been a party member before his candidacy was announced, and contributed to a former vice-president, Kevin Brown, resigning his membership.[22] Some of Blundell's political positions have been controversial within the party, notably his support for same-sex marriage and the abolition of penalty rates.[23][24]

Personal life[edit]
Blundell has been married twice—first to Louise, a former manager, and second to Lidia, with whom he had two sons.[25] He left his second wife in August 2007 for Jesse Curran, a singer who he had met at one of his concerts and while she was a contestant on Australian Idol. He and Curran have since had two children together, Fian Blundell and Ria Blundell.[26][21]
Blundell was engaged to Kristal Padget in 2017.[27] In March 2020 he announced his engagement to Rebecca Williams, 28 years after she inspired his 1992 hit "Down on the Farm".[28]
In May 2010, Blundell filed for bankruptcy, having gone into debt attempting to finance his albums, as well as having lost money on the sale of an investment property the previous year.[29] The bankruptcy was discharged in April 2013—had it not been, he would have ineligible to stand as a candidate for election.[20]
Blundell's brother, Peter Blundell, died on 24 December 2021. He was a former mayor of the Stanthorpe Shire and the Southern Downs Region as well as the LNP candidate for Keppel in the 2017 Queensland state election.[30][31]
