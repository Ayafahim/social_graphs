First Aid Kit is a Swedish folk duo consisting of the sisters Johanna and Klara Söderberg, born in 1990 and 1993 respectively.[2] When performing live, they are accompanied by a drummer, a guitarist and a keyboard player. First Aid Kit started to become internationally known in 2008 with their YouTube uploaded cover of the Fleet Foxes' song "Tiger Mountain Peasant Song".[1][3][4] In 2012 Rolling Stone magazine had their song "Emmylou" as 10th on their "Single of the Year" list.[5] First Aid Kit has released five albums, four EPs and several singles. In 2015, they were nominated for a Brit Award as one of the five best international groups.[6] They were nominated again in 2019 and 2023.[7][8]


Early history[edit]
Sisters Johanna (born 31 October 1990) and Klara (born 8 January 1993) Söderberg are from Enskede, in Stockholm.[2] Their father Benkt Söderberg was a member of the Swedish rock pop band Lolita Pop,[9]: 3:20–4:03  but quit before Johanna was born and became a teacher of history and religion.[10] Their mother teaches cinematography.[11]
From childhood, Klara and Johanna were eager singers, giving concerts using a jump rope as a pretend microphone.[9]: 0:40–2:40  Klara's favorite songs were Judy Garland's songs from The Wizard of Oz and Billie Holiday's version of "Gloomy Sunday", which she sang without much understanding of the English lyrics.[12] Klara wrote her first song, "Femton mil i min Barbiebil" [Fifteen Scandinavian miles in my Barbie car], when she was six.[13]
Klara and Johanna both attended the Internationella Engelska Skolan ( International English School ) of Enskede.[14] Klara applied for admission to Adolf Fredrik's Music School, but was not accepted.[15][16]
In 2005, when Klara was 12, a friend introduced her to the band Bright Eyes.[12] This led her to country and folk music stars such as Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, the Carter Family, Louvin Brothers, Townes Van Zandt, Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris. The same year, she received a guitar as a Christmas present[10] and quickly learned to play it.
Johanna enjoyed a wide range of music, from Britney Spears to German techno.[17][18] When she saw the film O Brother, Where Art Thou? and listened to its soundtrack, she was inspired to sing "Down in the River to Pray" with Klara. Fascinated by the result, the two began to sing together, first at home and then as street singers in the Stockholm metro and in front of liquor stores.[9]: 16:10–17:55 [19]: 2:55-4:35  Klara chose the name for their band at age 13 by looking through a dictionary. She found the term "first aid kit" and thought it best described what she wanted her music to be.[10]
Klara and Johanna began to write their own country-folk songs inspired by Devendra Banhart and CocoRosie, among others,[12] without much influence from their parents, who were fonder of Patti Smith, Velvet Underground and the Pixies.[10] Their father has said that he was astonished and a little jealous of the ease his daughters had in producing their music.[20]: 8:20–8:55  The most important advice their father gave them was to sing so loud that even somebody behind a wall could hear it.[12]

Career[edit]
2007–2009: Beginnings and Drunken Trees EP[edit]
In April 2007, the sisters began to upload their self-made songs to the social networking site MySpace.[13] They also sent a demo of their song "Tangerine" to  Swedish radio.[21] It immediately went on air and was listed as one of the best songs of the summer 2007,[22] which led to requests for live performances and even some offers from record companies. The first official performance as First Aid Kit was at PUNKTmedis library in Stockholm on 6 October.[14][23] More performances followed, but as Klara was 14 and still at school, they could only play during weekends.
Coincidentally, their younger brother attended the same kindergarten as the daughter of Karin Dreijer, half of Swedish electronic duo The Knife, also known as Fever Ray.[13] Their mother asked Dreijer to check out her daughters' songs on MySpace.[12] The band subsequently signed with Rabid Records, a label co-owned by The Knife, with conditions that allowed the duo to have full control over their music and album art.[10]
In April 2008, the band released their debut EP Drunken Trees in Sweden, and made their first appearance on Swedish TV.[13][24] The EP was produced by their father, and was a re-recorded collection of songs from their MySpace, originally entitled "Cross Oceans".
The duo was relatively well known in Sweden by August 2008, when they uploaded a cover version of "Tiger Mountain Peasant Song" by Fleet Foxes to YouTube. Robin Pecknold, frontman and lead guitarist for Fleet Foxes, praised the cover on his band's webpage, causing a surge in popularity for the video.[10][9]: 32:40-34:30  This exposure led to international recognition, and by the end of 2008, the duo had signed a record deal with Wichita Records.

Due to international touring, Johanna quit high school in the autumn of 2008 (and Klara never started).[25] Their father took a leave from his job as a teacher and accompanied them on tour. First Aid Kit's first show outside Scandinavia took place on 22 November 2008 at the Crossing Border Festival in Netherlands. Fleet Foxes performed the day before, and when Pecknold spotted the duo standing at the edge of the stage, they were spontaneously asked to join to sing "Tiger Mountain Peasant Song".[9]: 34:30–35:10 [19]: 6:15–7:35 
Wichita re-released Drunken Trees on 23 February 2009 as an enhanced EP, with "Tiger Mountain Peasant Song" added as a bonus track, along with several videos.

2010–2011: The Big Black and the Blue[edit]
The duo released their first album, The Big Black and the Blue on 1 February 2010.[26] As with the Drunken Trees EP, the album was again produced by their father. The release was followed by an extensive tour throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and parts of Europe, including Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona.[27][28][29][30][31]
On 19 November 2009, Klara and Johanna met Conor Oberst after Monsters of Folk's concert in Stockholm, and gave him a demo of their coming album.[32] Oberst watched the duo perform at the Austin City Limits Music Festival pre-party in Texas on 7 October 2010. At this concert, he was especially impressed by the duo's acoustic performance of Ghost Town, which the audience listened to in rapt silence. After meeting the duo, Oberst called Mike Mogis and asked him to see the duo's performance at the ACL Festival two days later, on October 9.[12] After watching this performance, Mogis offered to produce the duo's next album.[9]: 29:20–31:20 [33]
Two days later, on 11 October 2010, after playing a concert in Nashville, the duo received a telephone call from Jack White, who asked the duo to visit his studio the next day.[12] The result was a vinyl single containing cover versions of Buffy Sainte-Marie's "Universal Soldier" and Mel London's and Tampa Red's "It Hurts Me Too". The single was released on White's Third Man Records label.[9]: 35:30–36:55 [34]
First Aid Kit performed at the Polar Music Prize gala on 30 August 2011 in Stockholm, where they performed the song "Dancing Barefoot" for the winner Patti Smith. Smith was moved to tears at the intense ending of the song.[9]: 4:03–6:40 
Johanna, under the moniker MoA, released song covers of K-Pop artists such as 2NE1 and 4Minute[35] during 2010 to 2011. The covers were deleted after her identity was inadvertently revealed.

2012–2013: The Lion's Roar[edit]
First Aid Kit (Frankfurt am Main, 18 February 2012)
In January 2012, the band released their second album, The Lion's Roar, produced by Mike Mogis. The album was critically acclaimed, debuting at number one in Sweden and number 35 in the UK. The duo toured extensively in support of the album, including performances at several major festivals.[36][37][38][39] The duo performed the song "Emmylou" on Conan in April 2012,[40] and on The Late Show with David Letterman in October 2012.[41]
On 28 August 2012, they performed "America" for the Polar Music Prize winner Paul Simon, who gave the duo a standing ovation.[42]

In November 2012, the duo received awards for "Composer of the year" and "Breakthrough of the Year" from the Swedish Music Publishers Association.[45] The song "Emmylou" was listed at 10th position by Rolling Stone magazine in their "Single of the Year" list of 2012.[5] In February 2013, First Aid Kit was awarded the Nordic Music Prize for Best Nordic 2012 Album.[46][47] They were also awarded four Swedish Grammis awards for 2012 "Artist of the Year", "Songwriter of the Year", "Best Pop of the Year" and "Album of the Year".[48][49]

Their third studio album, Stay Gold, was released on 10 June 2014 through Columbia Records.[50] The band released two singles from the album: "My Silver Lining" and "Cedar Lane".[51][52] As a result, the duo again received the "Composer of the year" prize from the Swedish Music Publishers Association.[53] In January 2015, First Aid Kit was nominated for the 2015 Brit Awards in the Best International Group category as one of five nominees,[6] and won the "Best group of the year" prize in the Swedish Radio P3 Gold Gala.[54] In the same month, the band was featured on a Swedish postage stamp.[55] The album Stay Gold was listed at number 6 in the Paste magazine's 40 best folk albums of the 2010s list.[56]
First Aid Kit began touring again in May 2014, visiting North America, Europe, Japan and Australia.[57] The final performance was on 15 August 2015, at Way Out West Festival in Gothenburg, Sweden.[58] Except for two Christmas concerts with Seinabo Sey, Amanda Bergman and Maja Francis on 13 December 2015 in Stockholm,[59] the duo performed no concerts again until summer 2017, as they needed a break in order to prepare the new record.[60]: 8:30–8:50
