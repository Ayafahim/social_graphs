Early life and education[edit]
Fox grew up in a musical family in the Vancouver suburb of Coquitlam, British Columbia.[7][2][8] His father John worked in radio broadcasting, while his mother Ella was an oboe player in a chamber orchestra.[8] His three brothers later pursued careers in music and acting.[8] He left Coquitlam after graduating from Centennial Secondary, and traveled through Europe and the Middle East.[2]

Career[edit]
Fox moved to Toronto in the mid-1980s to pursue a career in music, performing and writing songs for several folk, R&B, and rockabilly bands, and working as a sound engineer.[7][2] While fronting a rockabilly band called The Tin Eddies, he got his break with a solo rock LP, Where The Blue Moon Rises.[8][9] In 1993, he had his first minor hit, The Days of My Youth, on the True North/Sony label, and was nominated for a Juno Award for Best Male Vocalist.[2] In 2001 he released Small World which went platinum and led to the notable singles "Small Town", "Cheap Red Wine" and "Couple On The Cake", a duet with Beverley Mahood, and a video featuring Leslie Nielsen. He released the album Lunch With Chet with the single "Dream On".[citation needed] He is noted for writing the Montgomery Gentry single "Daddy Won't Sell The Farm", which reached No. 13 on the Billboard music chart and  No. 1 on CMT; it won the Canadian Country Music Association SOCAN song of the year award.[7] He wrote "24 X 24", recorded by Gord Bamford.[6]
Fox produced records for other artists, and released his own single, "If My Life Was a Movie" in January 2007.[citation needed]
