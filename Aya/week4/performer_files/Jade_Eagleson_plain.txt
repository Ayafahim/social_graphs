Jade Eagleson (born May 23, 1994) is a Canadian country singer and songwriter from Bailieboro, Ontario. He has released three albums: Jade Eagleson (2020),  Honkytonk Revival (2021), and Do It Anyway (2023).[1] He has also released nine singles, achieving four number one Canada Country hits with "Lucky", "All Night to Figure It Out", "More Drinkin' Than Fishin'" and "She Don't Know".


Early life[edit]
Eagleson was born and raised on his grandparents's farm in Bailieboro, Ontario. He tended crops and raised livestock with his father before initially heading to Alberta for work at age 19. He then elected to move back to Bailieboro and pursue a career in country music.[2][3] Eagleson cites Paul Brandt as one of his biggest musical influences,[4] while also viewing Alan Jackson, Randy Travis, George Strait, and Shania Twain as major idols.[5]

Career[edit]
2017–2020: Early career and self-titled album[edit]
In 2017, Eagleson won the Emerging Artist Showcase at the Boots and Hearts Music Festival.[6][7] In May 2018, Eagleson released "Got Your Name on It", his debut single on Umusic.[8] It would peak at #6 on the Billboard Canada Country chart[9] and at #90 on the Canadian Hot 100.[10] The song has been certified Platinum by Music Canada.[11] Later that year, Eagleson released his debut self-titled extended play.[12] The EP included Eagleson's second single "Count the Ways", which was also certified Platinum by Music Canada and peaked at #4 on the Canada Country chart.[9][13][14]
In October 2019, Eagleson released his third single "Lucky".[15][16] Eagleson was then awarded "Rising Star" at the 2019 CCMA Awards.[17] "Lucky" then became Eagleson's first #1 hit on the Canada Country chart in 2020.[18][19] In April 2020, Eagleson released his fourth single "Close",[20] which would peak at #8 on the Canada Country chart, and #88 on the Canadian Hot 100 (a new career high).[9][10] His debut studio album Jade Eagleson was released on July 24, 2020 and included all four of his previous singles.[21][22]

2021–present: Honkytonk Revival and Do It Anyway[edit]
In February 2021, Eagleson independently released the single "All Night to Figure It Out".[23] It would become his second Number One Canada Country hit.[9] Shortly after, he released the single "More Drinkin' Than Fishin'", a collaboration with fellow Canadian country artist Dean Brody.[24][25][26] On November 12, 2021, Eagleson released his second studio album, Honkytonk Revival,[27] which included "All Night to Figure It Out" and "More Drinkin' Than Fishin'" as well as the single "She Don't Know".[28][29][30] As a result of each single off the album reaching number one, Eagleson joined Shania Twain as the only Canadian country artists to ever land three consecutive chart-toppers from their second studio album.[31]
In August 2022, he released the single "Shakin' in Them Boots".[31] At the 2022 Canadian Country Music Awards, Eagleson was awarded the Top Selling Canadian Album of the Year for Honkytonk Revival,[32] and received six other nominations.[33] In March 2023, he released the single "Rodeo Queen".[34][35] Both singles are included on his third studio album Do It Anyway, which was released on September 29, 2023.[36] At the 2023 Canadian Country Music Awards, Eagleson was named "Entertainer of the Year" and "Male Artist of the Year".[37] According to Mediabase, he was the most played domestic artist and the eight-most played artist overall on Canadian country radio in 2023.[38] "Telluride" became the fourth radio single off Do It Anyway in 2024. Later that year, he released a new version of the song "Do It Anyway" featuring American country artist Jake Worthington.[39] Eagleson won "Album of the Year" at the 2024 Canadian Country Music Awards for Do It Anyway.[40]

Personal life[edit]
Eagleson married his longtime girlfriend Marina Paquin in 2019.[41] Later that year, Marina gave birth to their first son.[42] The couple’s second son was born in 2024.[43] They currently live in Nashville, Tennessee. Eagleson met Paquin on the set of the music video for his debut single "Got Your Name on It".[44] He considers himself a "proud Christian".[45]
