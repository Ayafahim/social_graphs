Keith Palmer (June 23, 1957 – June 13, 1996)[1] was an American country music artist. He was born Bryon Keith Palmer on June 23, 1957, in Hayti, Missouri, United States, and was raised in Corning, Arkansas. His name was actually supposed to be "Byron", but there was a mistake on the birth certificate.
He began his music career in 1975 as pianist for the Dixie Echoes, where he remained for three years. In 1991, Palmer released an album for Epic Records which produced two singles: "Don't Throw Me in the Briarpatch" and "Forgotten but Not Gone", both of which entered the U.S. Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart (now Hot Country Songs). He also co-wrote Reba McEntire's 1991 single "For My Broken Heart". Palmer died of cancer on June 13, 1996, in White House, Tennessee, at age 38.
