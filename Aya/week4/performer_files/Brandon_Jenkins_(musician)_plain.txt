One of Jenkins' notable songs, "Refinery Blues," was a biographical ballad about growing up near the Sand Springs Line, an area where oil refineries abound near the Arkansas River tributary of the Mississippi River.[7]
Jenkins was also a philanthropist as a supporter of the Red Dirt Relief Fund, a non-profit organization that supports musicians from the Red Dirt family of artists who face financial hardship.[8]


Early life[edit]
Jenkins was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to parents Wilma Jenkins (née Linthicum) and Dean Jenkins, a popular Tulsa radio disc jockey on stations KELi (where he was known as Dean Kelly) and KMOD-FM.[9][10]
In 1987, Jenkins graduated from Central High School in Tulsa, where he was in the jazz band, sang in the choir, and taught himself guitar.[11] In the 1980s, He attended Oklahoma State University in Stillwater.[12] During his time at OSU, Jenkins made life-long friends with many of his long-term musical collaborators in the Red Dirt Music community, including Cody Canada, Mike McClure, Stoney LaRue, and Bleu Edmondson.[13]
Jenkins' uncle was the Grammy Award-winning bass player, sound engineer, and producer, Gordon Shryock, who was known for his work with J. J. Cale and Leon Russell, as well as Andrae Crouch, Elvis Presley, Natalie Cole, and Dwight Yoakam.[14][15]

Career[edit]
In the early 1990s, Jenkins got his start recording for the Alabama-based record label, Rainy Records.[7]
In 2003, Jenkins moved from Oklahoma to Austin, Texas, where he lived until 2015.[12][16]
In 2005, Jenkins released Down in Flames and got a 3-year record deal for his Western Soul Records imprint to have his work distributed by Sony/RED. The record came out on the Thirty Tigers label.[17]
In 2008, Jenkins released Faster Than a Stone, which featured Travis Fite and Stoney LaRue.[18][19]
Jenkins' 2009 album Brothers of the Dirt was a collaboration with many Red Dirt and Texas country scene artists: Cody Canada (Cross Canadian Ragweed), Stoney LaRue, Jason Boland, and Randy Rogers.[20] The record was his first release on the independent label E1 Entertainment/Red Dirt Music Co.[5] The song, "Out of Babylon," sung by Jenkins and Canada, was a tribute to 9/11, while the song, "Innocent Man," is a LaRue and Rogers contribution inspired by the John Grisham novel about Ron Williamson, The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town.[9] The song, "Blood for Oil," was a protest song that focuses on George W.

Also in 2015, Jenkins released Brandon Jenkins @ Radio Recorders, which he recorded for Pride Hutchison and Dale Lawton's Tulsa-based label, Explosive Records.[14] The record was made in 2006 in the Southern California record studio called Radio Recorders.[21] Since Jenkins' music was firmly in the Texas country genre, this record was held onto for release, some nine years later.[21]

Fellow Red Dirt artists Bleu Edmondson ("Finger on the Trigger") and Stoney LaRue ("Feet Don't Touch The Ground") recorded and performed songs written by Jenkins.[7] The song, "Feet Don't Touch The Ground," was praised by KKCN as being one of the top 5 recorded songs by Stoney LaRue,[24][25] and features on his album Live at Billy Bob's Texas. His song "Down in Flames," co-written by Stoney LaRue, appeared on The Red Dirt Album.[7]
