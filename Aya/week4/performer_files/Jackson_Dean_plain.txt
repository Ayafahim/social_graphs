Biography[edit]
Dean was born in Odenton, Maryland. He left his hometown at age 18 to begin songwriting, which led to collaborations with Casey Beathard and Luke Dick. After serving as an opening act for Kane Brown, Jake Owen, and Brothers Osborne, he was signed to Big Machine Records in 2021.[2] Dean's first release for Big Machine was a self-titled extended play with the single "Wings", the former of which was released on April 16, 2021.[3]
Dean's debut single, "Don't Come Lookin'", was released in February 2022, followed by his debut album, Greenbroke, on March 11, 2022. In addition, he was booked as an opening act for Brooks & Dunn's Reboot 2022 Tour.[4] "Don't Come Lookin'" peaked at number three on the Billboard Country Airplay chart in November. The song was also featured in an episode of the Paramount Network TV series Yellowstone.[2] "Fearless (The Echo)" was released as the second single from Greenbroke in 2023, and it reached a peak of number 11 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart in 2024.
Dean's second studio album, On the Back of My Dreams, will be released on September 6, 2024.[5] Its lead single, "Heavens to Betsy", was released in August 2024.[6]
