Early life[edit]
Mote was born, on October 25,[2] 1970, in Gadsden, Alabama, as a blind person,[3] where he grew up in nearby Attalla. He attended both Jacksonville State University, where he spent the first three years of his music education, while he transferred to Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he graduated with honors in music.[3]

Music career[edit]
Just after graduating, Lee Greenwood asked Mote to join his band. Since then, he has toured with artists such as Trisha Yearwood, Tanya Tucker, Porter Wagoner, the Gaither Vocal Band, and the Gaither Homecoming Tour. In 2001, when a pianist was needed for Alan Jackson's "Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)" recording, Mote was recommended. After that, he became a very sought-after studio musician, playing on numerous country and gospel artist's albums.[4]
His studio album, Don't Let Me Miss the Glory, was his debut as a vocalist.[3] It was released on October 23, 2007,[5] with Spring Hill Records.[6] This album was his breakthrough, appearing on the Billboard magazine charts, peaking at No. 170 on the Billboard 200[7] and No. 10 on the Christian Albums chart.[8]
