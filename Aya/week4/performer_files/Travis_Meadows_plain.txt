Travis Meadows (born 1965) is an American country music singer and songwriter. He has released four albums and written a number of songs for other country artists.


Early life[edit]
Meadows was born in 1965 in Mississippi, growing up in Jackson.[1][2] He began using drugs at an early age,[1] and at 14 was diagnosed with bone cancer, which led to the loss of most of his right leg.[1]

Career[edit]
At the age of 16, he began playing in local bands, starting his musical career as a drummer before beginning to play the harmonica and guitar by the time he was 21.[2] During his early 20s, he performed with blues musicians such as Sam Myers, and moved to Gatlinburg, where he began writing songs.[2] In his mid-20s, Meadows became a Christian missionary and later a preacher, traveling around the United States and overseas, as well as writing and performing Christian music.[2] By his late 30s, however, he had become disenchanted with the church, and moved to Nashville to pursue a songwriting career.[2] He signed a contract with Universal Music Publishing, releasing his debut album My life 101 I'm 2007, but at the same time his life-long drinking and drug habits led to a multi-year descent into alcoholism and abuse.[1] After four trips to rehab, he succeeded in regaining sobriety in 2010.[1]
In 2011, Meadows released a studio album, titled Killin' Uncle Buzzy, written in 2010 while he was recovering from his alcohol addiction during his fourth period in rehab.[1] According to Meadows, a counselor had suggested keeping a journal, which led to him writing songs instead.[1] In 2013, after his songwriting contract with Universal expired, he began writing independently before signing with independent record label Kobalt Music and releasing a third album, Old Ghosts & Unfinished Business.[2]
In 2016, Meadows was featured in an episode of the television show American Elements.[3]
In 2017, Meadows released his fourth album, First Cigarette. The album was produced by Jeremy Spillman and assisted by Jay Joyce, and is the first album by Meadows to receive label support.[4] It is also his first album to appear on Billboard charts, reaching No. 21 on Heatseekers Albums and No. 48 on Independent Albums. It sold 1,100 copies in its debut week,[5] reaching No. 17 on Americana/Folk Album Sales and No. 34 on Country Album Sales.[6]
In April 2021, Earache Records reissued Killin' Uncle Buzzy for the record's 10th Anniversary, including a limited edition clear vinyl. This was the first time the album had been available on vinyl and released by a label.[7][8]
