Kaitlyn Adrianna Baker[1] (born November 23, 1994)[citation needed] is an American country singer and songwriter.


Early life[edit]
Kaitlyn Adrianna Baker was born and raised in Pound, Virginia.[1] Her father, grandfather and other family members worked in coal mines. Virginia Living magazine referred to her as a new "coal miner's daughter."[2] Baker started singing in church and then professionally as a young girl at events in her area.[3]

Career[edit]
Baker's debut single, "Burn", reached number fifty four on the MusicRow Breakout Chart in 2015, and inspired the creation of Kaitlyn Baker's BURN Sauce, a hot sauce produced by Pepper Palace in Sevierville, Tennessee.[4] Baker has said that the song, which is about a woman who gets revenge on her cheating husband, was loosely based on something that happened to her grandmother.[5]
In March 2015, her ballad, "Coal Train", was included on the 2015 ACM Awards ZinePak, a 2-CD album released by the Academy of Country Music and distributed exclusively through Walmart.[6]  The album debuted at number four on the Billboard Country Albums chart.[7]
In November 2015, Baker released a cover of the classic Christmas song "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" in association with The Mansion Entertainment, a Nashville-based record label.[8]
In June 2016, she released "Heart of Appalachia," a song about her native Southwest Virginia. In a review, music critic Tom Netherland wrote, "Southwest Virginia glows in Baker's song."[9]   "Heart of Appalachia" was designated the official theme song of the Heart of Appalachia Tourism Authority, a nonprofit organization that promotes tourism in the region. An accompanying music video included cameo appearances by prominent bluegrass artists Ralph Stanley II and Larry Cordle. Cordle co-produced and sang background vocals on the record. Songwriter and musician Scott Arnold, who wrote the song with Baker, produced the music tracks.[10]
In September 2016, Baker released her single "To Pieces" to country radio.[11] An accompanying music video premiered on The Heartland Network, a national cable and satellite television channel.[12]
A member of Baker's band, guitarist Thomas Estep, was killed in a drunk-driving indicent on January 1, 2017, when another vehicle crossed over the center line and collided with his vehicle on a Virginia highway.[13] As a result of the crash, Baker partnered with Mothers Against Drunk Driving to perform at the annual MADD Law Enforcement Recognition Banquet in Southwest Virginia.[14] She also announced that she was working on a new EP titled "Blackbird," which she planned to dedicate in Estep's memory.[15]
Baker released her EP "Blackbird" in April, 2018, with performances in Big Stone Gap, Virginia, and Gate City, Virginia. One song on the project, "Sassyfras Tea," was co-written by Baker and acclaimed country songwriters Tony Mullins and Larry Cordle.[16] The pop culture website BuzzFeed listed her among eleven "Badass Alternatives to Bro Country."[17]
Notable appearances by Baker include Country Jam Colorado,[18][19] the Riverbend Festival in Chattanooga, Tennessee,[20]  the Young Artist Awards in Los Angeles, California,[21] the Findlay Market – Cincinnati Reds Opening Day parade,[22] and "Song of the Mountains", a nationally syndicated public television concert series.[23] In concert, she has opened for popular artists including Craig Morgan,[24] Jim Lauderdale,[25] Travis Tritt, Billy Currington, Chase Bryant, Rhonda Vincent, and others.[specify]
