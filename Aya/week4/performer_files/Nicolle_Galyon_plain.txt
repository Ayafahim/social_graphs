Nicolle Anne Galyon (born July 22, 1984) is a singer, songwriter, producer, record label executive, and publishing executive based in Nashville. She gained national exposure early in her career after a 2012 appearance as a contestant on NBC's The Voice. She co-wrote the song "Automatic" sung by Miranda Lambert which was named the 2015 ACM's 'Song of the Year' and the 2014 CMA's single of the year. As of 2023, she is credited for writing nine No. 1 hits. Galyon has written songs for Lady A, Keith Urban, Kenny Chesney, Dan + Shay, Florida Georgia Line, and others.


Early life[edit]
Nicolle was born to Chris and LaMonna (née Hahn) Galyon of Sterling, Kansas. She has three younger brothers: Riley, Taylor, and Cooper.

Career[edit]
Originally from Sterling, Kansas, Galyon made her way to Nashville, Tennessee in 2002 to attend Belmont University for Music Business. At Belmont, Galyon discovered her passion for songwriting [1] and signed a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Nashville shortly after graduating in 2006.[2] In 2012, she appeared on season 2 of The Voice as a contestant on Adam Levine's team, then being eliminated in the battle rounds.[3] There she met RaeLynn and Miranda Lambert, two friendships that she accredits for kickstarting her songwriting career.[3]
Galyon earned her first #1 song with "We Were Us" performed by Keith Urban and Miranda Lambert. Soon after this success, veteran Nashville songwriting heavyweights like Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne noticed her and invited her to be a part of their in-the-round performances.[4] Speaking about this later, Galyon said, "I remember it was conflicting for me because I only had one song to play that anyone knew...but they could each play 20 hits, all night long".[4] She said that their stamp of approval gave her confidence and kept her going.[4]
With co-writers Miranda Lambert and Natalie Hemby, Galyon won 2015 ACM's 'Song of the Year', and the 2014 CMA's single of the year for the Miranda Lambert's  Automatic. Since then Galyon has had songs recorded by RaeLynn on her album WildHorse, Dan + Shay on their album Obsessed, Kenny Chesney on his album Cosmic Hallelujah, Florida Georgia Line on their album Dig Your Roots, Lady Antebellum on their album Golden, and Thomas Rhett on his album Tangled Up, among others.

Record label[edit]
Galyon partnered with Big Loud Records to launch the female-focused record label, "Songs and Daughters". The label was announced in July, 2019 and signed Madison Kozak as its flagship artist. In 2020, Galyon expanded the label to include a publishing arm. In 2020, Galyon served as a producer and writer on iHeartRadio scripted podcast "Make It Up As We Go." 

Philanthropy[edit]
Galyon is heavily involved in the CMA Foundation's music education initiative and served as an NSAI Board Member & CMT Next Women of Country mentor. Galyon has worked with the "Save the Music Foundation", a non-profit music education organization[5] and with "Songfarm", a philanthropic organization designed to give U.S.high schools professional recording equipment for students to use.[6] She also provides a college scholarship to a senior at her alma mater, Sterling High School, each year through an "Autobiography Scholarship" program.

Personal life[edit]
Galyon married songwriter Rodney Clawson October 13, 2007. They have two children together, daughter Charlie Jo Clawson born May 29, 2013, and son Ford Sterling Clawson born April 14, 2015.
