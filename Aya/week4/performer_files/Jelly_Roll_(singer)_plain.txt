Musical artist
Jason Bradley DeFord (born December 4, 1984), known professionally as Jelly Roll (originally stylized as JellyRoll), is an American singer, rapper, and songwriter from Antioch, Tennessee. Beginning his career in 2003, he rose to mainstream prominence following the release of his 2022 singles "Son of a Sinner" and "Need a Favor".
"Son of a Sinner" won three CMT Music Awards in 2023.[5] That same year, he won for New Artist at the CMA Awards, and was nominated for Best New Artist at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards.


Early life[edit]
DeFord was raised in the Antioch neighborhood of Nashville, Tennessee.[6][7] His father was a meat salesman and worked as a bookie on the side; his mother suffered from mental illness and addiction.[8]
From his teenage years into his 20s, Jelly Roll was arrested several times and spent time in jail for various charges/felonies including possession of marijuana and aggravated robbery.[9][8]  While imprisoned, he earned his GED at the age of 23.[8]

Career[edit]
Jelly Roll launched his career in hip hop after being inspired by rappers such as Three 6 Mafia, UGK, and 8Ball & MJG. He sold mixtapes out of his car,[8] starting with a string of releases from his first project The Plain Shmear Tape in 2003 then following with the four part Gamblin' on the White Boy series from 2004 to 2011. His 2010 collaboration "Pop Another Pill" with Memphis rapper Lil Wyte reached over 6.3 million YouTube views.[10] This song led to the album Year Round by the hip-hop group SNO, of which Jelly Roll was a member. Over the next few years, Jelly Roll released many mixtapes and independent solo albums including collaborations with Lil Wyte, Struggle Jennings, Haystak, and Tech N9ne.[11] Jelly Roll's 2013 mixtape Whiskey, Weed, & Women was originally named Whiskey, Weed, & Waffle House,[6] but was later changed after Waffle House threatened legal action over the use of their name and logo on the cover. The replacement cover featured a "cease and desist" stamp in place of the restaurant's logo.[12][13]
Jelly Roll made his Grand Ole Opry debut on November 9, 2021.[14] On July 7, 2022, he was invited by fellow country singer Craig Morgan to join him on stage at the Opry to perform "Almost Home".[15] On May 9, 2022, Jelly Roll scored his first number one on rock radio with the track "Dead Man Walking".[16] In January 2023, Jelly Roll scored his first number-one song on Country radio with his debut country single "Son of a Sinner", written by himself, Ernest, and David Ray Stevens. The track was the second single from the 2021 album Ballads of the Broken and also peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart.[17] In February 2023, he made history with a record-breaking 25th week at number 1 on Billboard's Emerging Artists chart.[18] Jelly Roll sold out Nashville's Bridgestone Arena on December 9, 2022, to 15,000 fans and was joined by Chris Young, Sam Hunt, Riley Green, Shinedown, Ernest, Struggle Jennings, Tech N9ne, and Krizz Kaliko.[19] In the summer of 2023, he completed a 44-city 'Backroad Baptism Tour'.[20] At the 2023 CMT Music Awards, Jelly Roll won for Male Video of the Year, Male Breakthrough Video of the Year, and Digital-First Performance of the Year, all for the song "Son of a Sinner".[21][22]
Jelly Roll released his album Whitsitt Chapel featuring the single "Need a Favor" on June 2, 2023.[23] In November 2023, Jelly Roll won the award for New Artist of the Year at the 57th Annual Country Music Association Awards. In January 2024, Jelly Roll testified before the U.S. Congress, in support of anti-fentanyl legislation.[24] Explaining his perspective as a former distributor of illegal drugs, Jelly Roll stated before the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee  “I was a part of the problem. I am here now, standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution".[25]
In April 2024, Jelly Roll was sued by Pennsylvania-based wedding band Jellyroll for trademark infringement.[26] In July 2024, Jelly Roll was featured on Eminem's twelfth album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) on the track "Somebody Save Me", which sampled his song "Save Me". He appeared in its music video released the following month.[27] On July 8 Jelly Roll made his first international appearance at the Meridian Centre in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada.[28] On August 23, 2024, Jelly Roll announced his upcoming album Beautifully Broken. It is scheduled to be released on October 11, 2024.[29]
Jelly Roll made his television debut on the television drama series Tulsa King with Sylvester Stallone. The episode was released in September 2024 and featured Jelly Roll performing a rendition of "I Am Not Okay".[30]

Personal life[edit]
Jelly Roll has been married to his wife Alyssa DeFord, known as "Bunnie XO", since 2016. The couple renewed their wedding vows in 2023. He has two children: daughter Bailee (b. 2008) from a previous relationship, whom he and Bunnie have full custody of, and son Noah (b. 2016) from another previous relationship.[31][32]
