Aaron Pritchett (born August 2, 1970) is a Canadian country music singer. He had a #1 hit on the Billboard Canada Country chart with "Better When I Do", and has landed gold-certified hits with "Hold My Beer", "Dirt Road in 'Em" and "Worth a Shot".[2][3]


Biography[edit]
Pritchett got his start as a DJ at Rooster's Country Cabaret bar in Pitt Meadows, BC, and played in a house band performing cover tunes. He recorded his first album in 1996 titled Young in Love. In 2001, after years of playing clubs in BC and Alberta, Pritchett entered a singing contest called "Project Discovery" sponsored by CMT and won a professional music video directed by internationally acclaimed director, Steven Goldmann as well as $10,000 cash. He put the money towards recording his first album, titled "Consider This". The title track was co-written by Pritchett and longtime BC Country artist Rick Tippe.
Pritchett then released his next two albums Something Going On Here in 2003 and Big Wheel in 2006. The latter included the single "Hold My Beer", which won Songwriter(s) of the Year at the 2007 Canadian Country Music Awards.[4]
In 2008 he was signed to 604 Records, the production company of Nickelback's Chad Kroeger. Pritchett toured Western Canada with Toby Keith and fellow 604 Records artist Jessie Farrell to promote his album, Thankful, which was released on September 9, 2008.
Pritchett released the album In the Driver's Seat on November 9, 2010, under his own record label Decibel Music. Pritchett's first greatest hits album, Body of Work: A Collection of Hits, was released on May 12, 2015.[5] under Big Star Recordings.
In June 2016, Pritchett released his album The Score, a title that commemorated his 20th year recording and releasing music. The lead off single "Dirt Road in 'Em" went to No. 6 on the charts and marked a comeback in Pritchett's career as it was his first top 10 single since 2009. The second release, "Out Of The Blue" followed suit reaching No. 9. The album was nominated for Country Album of the Year at the 2017 Juno Awards. His release "When A Momma's Boy Meets A Daddy's Girl" peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Canada Country chart.
In April 2019, Pritchett scored his first #1 hit on the Billboard Canada Country chart with "Better When I Do".[6]
