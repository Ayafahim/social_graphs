George Canyon (born Frederick George Lays,[3] August 22, 1970) is a Canadian country music singer. He was the runner up on the second season of Nashville Star in 2004.  He grew up in Fox Brook, Pictou County, Nova Scotia before he moved west to Calgary, Alberta. He also holds an appointment in the Canadian Forces as the Colonel Commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets.[4]


Biography[edit]
George Canyon has held many jobs: he spent time working as a bylaw enforcement officer/special constable, a slaughterhouse beef inspector, and the owner/operator of his own recording studio. He always dreamed of becoming a professional musician.[5]
Canyon is the father of two children. His wife worked three jobs during the day so that he could sing at night. In 2004, George Canyon competed in Nashville Star 2. He was the runner-up in the competition, but became very well known in Canada and garnered much support, being the only Canadian to make the cut for the competition. After the competition ended, he received many accolades from fans and the industry alike. These include the top 5 hit "My Name", a Juno Award for Best Country Recording of the Year (for his album One Good Friend), and, four Canadian Country Music Awards Nominations (CCMAs) including Male Vocalist of the Year and the Fan Choice Award.
On September 22, 2007, Canyon performed at China-Canada: Hand in Hand;[6] a joint concert held in Vancouver between CCTV (China Central Television) and CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) to commemorate the one-year countdown of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.  One of the songs performed by Canyon was "What a Fine Jasmine Blossom". Sung entirely in Mandarin, Canyon performed the duet with Mandarin singer Tang Can.[7]
On January 9, 2008, Canadian defence minister Peter MacKay appointed Canyon to the position of honorary colonel at 14 Wing Greenwood, the largest air base on the east coast.[8] After this appointment expired in December 2011, Canyon was appointed colonel commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets.[4]
Canyon was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 14 and has given talks to children about diabetes.[9]
On October 16, 2014, Canyon was named the official anthem singer for the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League.[10]
In 2020, Canyon appeared as a panelist on Canada Reads, advocating for Jesse Thistle's memoir From the Ashes.[11]
In 2022, Canyon published a memoir entitled My Country, in which he describes his musical career from Nova Scotia to Nashville and back.[12]

Acting[edit]
In addition to his singing career, Canyon has also performed as an actor in movies and television. His first role of note was as "Head Forest Ranger" in several episodes during the seventh season of the popular Showcase television series Trailer Park Boys in 2007. He also appeared as the character "Charlie Wells" in the series Heartland in 2008. His most notable film role to date was as the character "Cattle Jack" in the 2012 film Dawn Rider, a remake of a 1935 John Wayne film of the same name. In 2013, he had role on the movie Coming Home for Christmas and Hallmark channel's One Starry Christmas.

Politics[edit]
In 2014, Canyon briefly ran for the Conservative Party of Canada nomination in the newly created riding of Bow River before withdrawing from the race later that year.[13][14] On August 21, 2019, Canyon was announced as the Conservative candidate for the riding of Central Nova for the federal election later that year,[15] where he came second to Liberal incumbent Sean Fraser.[16]
